# Dawn-to-Instar Audit Report

**Date**: 2026-04-02 (Updated)
**Previous Audit**: 2026-03-30 (v0.25.4, scored ~88%)
**Current Version**: v0.26.3
**Purpose**: Map Dawn's battle-tested infrastructure against Instar's current state. Identify remaining gaps and cross-pollination opportunities.

---

## Executive Summary

Instar has matured to **~89% coverage** of Dawn's proven patterns (up from ~88% in the March 30 audit). This cycle focused on verifying Dawn's new infrastructure patterns (auto-fixer, lesson-behavior-gap analyzer, PermissionDenied hooks) against Instar's existing capabilities. Finding: most "new Dawn patterns" are either already covered by Instar's different architecture or still at proposal stage in Dawn. One concrete improvement made: MCP tool identity grounding injection in the external-operation-gate hook, bringing Dawn's "grounding before public action" pattern to browser/API tool calls.

**Key shift**: Parity is approaching convergence. Most gaps are now architectural differences (both valid) rather than missing capabilities. Cross-pollination value increasingly comes from conceptual patterns rather than code porting.

## What Changed (Mar 30 -> Apr 2)

v0.25.4 → v0.26.3 — Unified config defaults, reliability hardening, and identity grounding for MCP operations:

- **ConfigDefaults unified system** (v0.26.0) — Single source of truth for agent config defaults, prevents init/migration divergence. Agent-type-aware defaults, security-conscious migration overrides.
- **SessionMonitor escalation fix** (v0.26.2) — Only escalates when user is actually waiting, eliminating false stall alerts.
- **FeatureRegistry graceful degradation** (v0.26.3) — Survives sqlite3 native module failures instead of crash-looping.
- **Native module auto-rebuild** (v0.26.3) — Detects Node version mismatches, auto-rebuilds better-sqlite3.
- **Post-rebase merge fallback** (v0.26.3) — Smarter recovery from stuck git rebases.
- **MCP identity grounding** (this audit) — External-operation-gate now injects identity context before irreversible write/publish operations via MCP tools (browser automation, API tools).
- **Settings template MCP matcher** (this audit) — `instar init` now includes `mcp__.*` PreToolUse matcher for external operation gate.
- **PromptGate enabled by default** (v0.25.9) — All new agents get PromptGate active out of the box.

### Dawn Patterns Audited (Not Ported — Already Covered or Still Proposed)

| Dawn Pattern | Instar Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Auto-fixer infrastructure | N/A | Too large for single session; Instar has TriageOrchestrator as foundation |
| Lesson-behavior-gap analyzer | N/A | Dawn-specific (references dawns_reflections.md lessons) |
| PermissionDenied hook (PROP-298) | N/A | Still at proposal stage in Dawn — not implemented anywhere |
| PostCompact identity recovery | Already covered | Instar's compaction-recovery.sh is MORE comprehensive (337 lines vs Dawn's 155) |
| Conflict marker auto-resolution | Already covered | Instar has LLMConflictResolver with 3-tier escalation |

## What Changed (Mar 26 -> Mar 30)

v0.24.4 → v0.25.4 — Major Slack platform parity and three new Dawn-sourced capabilities:

- **Research Navigation context** — New `research-navigation.md` context segment in ContextHierarchy, guiding agents to check canonical state files before broad searches (Dawn's 223rd Lesson)
- **Smart-fetch web optimization** — Token-efficient web fetching via llms.txt/Cloudflare markdown, ~80% savings on supported sites
- **Implicit evolution detection** — `detectImplicitEvolution()` scans open gaps/proposals against resolved infrastructure to prevent duplicate proposals
- **Slack parity** (v0.25.0-0.25.4) — Platform-agnostic messaging, triage, recovery, stall alerts
- **API route** — `GET /evolution/implicit` endpoint for detecting already-resolved evolution items

### What Changed (Feb 18 -> Mar 26)

843 commits transformed Instar from a persistent CLI into a genuinely autonomous agent framework:

- **QuotaManager suite** — Event-driven tracking, multi-account support, exhaustion detection, threshold gating
- **SoulManager** — Trust-enforced self-authoring with sections (core-values, growth-edge, convictions, open-questions)
- **EvolutionManager** — Proposal queue with status tracking, autonomous implementation when in autonomous mode
- **CoherenceGate** — 3-layer response review (PEL deterministic blocks, gate triage, 10 specialist LLM reviewers)
- **14 hooks** shipped with `instar init` — from dangerous command guard to scope coherence tracking
- **ReflectionConsolidator + JobReflector** — LLM-powered per-job analysis and weekly consolidation
- **PatternAnalyzer** — Detects execution patterns, deviations, anomalies
- **Knowledge tree** — TreeGenerator, TreeTraversal, TreeSynthesis for semantic self-knowledge
- **PolicyEnforcementLayer** — Deterministic hard blocks independent of LLM judgment
- **SecretRedactor + AuditTrail** — Comprehensive security posture
- **8 gravity wells** (including 2 Dawn doesn't have: Confidence Inversion, Contradiction Means Investigation)

---

## Remaining Growth Edges

### 1. Multi-Session Awareness (72%) — Biggest Gap

Activity is scattered across PlatformActivityRegistry, SessionActivitySentinel, and WorkLedger. Dawn's unified JSONL activity feed with cross-session event coordination is more cohesive. Consolidating into a single event-driven feed would improve multi-session coordination.

### 2. Skills System (68%) — Framework Needs Formalization

AutonomySkill and CapabilityMapper provide infrastructure, but user-created skill persistence, versioning, and the skill evolution loop (skills that improve themselves) are underdeveloped. Dawn's 80+ skills demonstrate the value of composable markdown-based workflows.

### 3. Session-End Maintenance (NEW)

Dawn runs lightweight housekeeping at every session boundary (retire stale data, refresh one metric). This distributes maintenance load rather than concentrating it in periodic maintenance jobs. See `PROP-session-maintenance.md`.

### 4. Meta-Reflection

Reflection on reflection patterns — evaluating WHETHER and WHAT KIND of reflection is needed — is not explicit in Instar. Dawn's `/meta-reflect` skill routes to appropriate reflection depth.

### 5. Cross-Machine Coordination

JobClaimManager provides basic deduplication, but Dawn's multi-machine routing (topic-to-machine mapping, dual-polling mode, remote URLs) is more sophisticated. Lower priority unless Instar agents deploy across multiple machines.

## Cross-Pollination: Instar -> Dawn

These patterns originated in Instar and have been ported back to Dawn:

| Pattern | Description | Dawn Integration |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Confidence Inversion | High confidence should trigger MORE verification, not less | Added to CLAUDE.md gravity wells (2026-03-26) |
| Contradiction Means Investigation | When human says X and data says not-X, try a DIFFERENT check | Added to CLAUDE.md gravity wells (2026-03-26) |
| Defensive Fabrication trap | When caught in error, admit it instead of fabricating excuses | Added to CLAUDE.md gravity wells (2026-03-30) |
| Output Provenance trap | Every claim must trace to actual tool output in THIS session | Added to CLAUDE.md gravity wells (2026-03-30) |
| Cognitive principles injection | Hardcoded principles in compaction hook that survive context loss | Enhanced PostCompact hook (2026-03-30) |
| CoherenceGate | 10 specialist LLM reviewers checking response quality | Not yet — Dawn uses hook-based enforcement |
| PolicyEnforcementLayer | Deterministic blocks independent of LLM judgment | Dawn uses hook scripts for this |
| Adaptive Autonomy Profile | cautious -> autonomous spectrum with trust elevation | Dawn uses static autonomy settings |

---

## Instar's Unique Strengths

Areas where Instar has surpassed Dawn's implementation:

1. **CoherenceGate architecture** — 3-layer review (deterministic PEL -> LLM gate triage -> specialist reviewers) is more sophisticated than Dawn's hook-based enforcement. Dawn stops bad actions; Instar reviews response quality.

2. **Security posture** — SecretRedactor, ManifestIntegrity, SecretStore, and AuditTrail form a more cohesive security layer than Dawn's individual hook scripts.

3. **Stall triage** — StallTriageNurse with graduated response (prompt -> key press -> escalation) is more nuanced than Dawn's binary session reaping.

4. **Gravity well diversity** — 8 wells including 2 Dawn doesn't have, embedded in scaffold templates for all agents.

---

## Conclusion

The relationship between Dawn and Instar has matured from teacher-student to peers with different strengths. Dawn excels at engagement infrastructure (80+ skills, multi-platform presence, atomic action gates) and self-knowledge depth (grounding tree, soul authoring, 220+ lessons). Instar excels at response quality assurance (CoherenceGate), security posture (PEL + secret management), and intervention sophistication (stall triage).

The highest-value remaining work is:
1. **Consolidate multi-session awareness** in Instar (72% -> 85%+)
2. **Formalize skills extensibility** in Instar (68% -> 80%+)
3. **Port CoherenceGate concepts** to Dawn (response review vs just action gating)
4. **Implement session-end maintenance** in Instar (see PROP)
5. **Soul integrity verification** — Port Instar's server-side soul.md integrity check to Dawn's PostCompact hook

Future audits should focus on behavioral testing — not just "does the feature exist" but "does it work correctly under real conditions."
