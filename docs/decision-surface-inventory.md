# Instar Decision-Surface Inventory

**Living document.** Updated as decision points are added, removed, or reclassified. All entries are subject to the `/instar-dev` side-effects review on any change.

**Principle reference:** [signal-vs-authority.md](./signal-vs-authority.md)

## Classification legend

- **Signal** — produces structured output for a downstream consumer; does not block on its own.
- **Authority** — holds direct block/allow/kill/route authority. Must be either (a) LLM-backed with full context + traceable reasoning, or (b) deterministic in a constrained domain where the principle explicitly does not apply (hard-invariant validation, idempotency at transport layer, irreversible-action guards).
- **Violator** — holds authority with brittle logic in a judgment-required domain. Requires rework.
- **Audit** — borderline case flagged for review but not confirmed as a violator yet.

## 1. Outbound messaging gates (agent → user)

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `server/routes.ts` — `checkOutboundMessage()` calling `MessagingToneGate.review()` | Whether an outbound message contains enumerated leak patterns (B1–B9 + B11–B14 rule set) | LLM-backed | **Authority — OK** | Sole outbound authority. Receives structured signals from junk, dedup, paraphrase, and jargon detectors plus recent conversation. `ToneReviewResult.rule` constrained to B1..B9 + B11–B14; citations outside the set fail-open with `invalidRule=true` (2026-04-15 rework). B10_PARAPHRASE_FLAGGED is reserved for observability — the gate may cite it in dashboard telemetry but never blocks on it alone. B11_STYLE_MISMATCH blocks messages that significantly violate the agent's configured `messagingStyle` (ELI10, formal, terse, etc.); does not apply when `messagingStyle` is unset. B12_HEALTH_ALERT_INTERNALS blocks health alert messages that contain internal jargon (job names, process IDs, infra terms the user cannot act on). B13_HEALTH_ALERT_SUPPRESSED_BY_HEAL blocks health alert messages that are no longer relevant because a registered `SelfHealer` resolved the issue. B14_HEALTH_ALERT_NO_CTA blocks health alert messages that lack a clear call-to-action for the user. Also wired directly into `DegradationReporter` (2026-04-29): health-alert candidates are pre-screened by the same gate before Telegram dispatch; `SAFE_HEALTH_ALERT_TEMPLATE` is used as fallback when gate blocks. |
| `core/junk-payload.ts` — `isJunkPayload()` (signal only) | Whether an outbound message looks like a debug token | Deterministic (literal tokens) | **Signal — OK** | Was a direct 422-block violator; reworked 2026-04-15 into a pure signal (`signals.junk`) fed into `checkOutboundMessage()`. No independent block authority. |
| `core/OutboundDedupGate.ts` — `check()` (signal only) | Whether an outbound message is a near-duplicate of a recent one | Deterministic (Jaccard 3-gram similarity) | **Signal — OK** | Was a direct 422-block violator; reworked 2026-04-15 into a pure signal (`signals.duplicate`) fed into `checkOutboundMessage()`. No independent block authority. |
| `core/LedgerParaphraseDetector.ts` — `check()` (signal only, Integrated-Being v1) | Whether an outbound message closely paraphrases a SharedStateLedger entry whose counterparty differs from the current outbound target | Deterministic (Jaccard over lowercased word sets, threshold ≥ 0.7) | **Signal — OK** | New in Integrated-Being v1. Emits `signals.paraphrase` into `checkOutboundMessage()`. Only compares against `provenance: subsystem-asserted` entries. Never blocks independently. |
| `core/JargonDetector.ts` — `detectJargon()` (signal only) | Whether a health-alert candidate message contains internal jargon terms that an end user cannot act on | Deterministic (literal token matching, word-boundary anchored) | **Signal — OK** | Intentionally brittle by design — literal list of ~25 terms (job, log, process, pid, cron, daemon, launchd, etc.). Brittleness is acceptable for a detector; only the tone gate authority acts on the signal. Emits `{ detected, terms, score }` into the gate's structured signals. Does not block independently. New 2026-04-29 (PR #105). |

## 2. Inbound message filtering (user → agent)

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/InputGuard.ts` — provenance tag check (Layer 1) | Whether a claimed [channel:id] tag actually matches its bound topic | Deterministic (tag extraction + lookup) | **Authority — OK** (hard-invariant: provenance forgery check at trust boundary) |
| `core/InputGuard.ts` — injection-pattern detection (Layer 1.5) | Whether a user message contains prompt-injection patterns | Deterministic (regex) | **Signal — OK** (emits warning; does not block unilaterally) |
| `core/InputGuard.ts` — topic-coherence review (Layer 2) | Whether a message fits the topic | LLM-backed | **Authority — OK** |
| `core/MessageSentinel.ts` — fast-path classifier | Whether a short user message is an emergency stop/cancel signal | Deterministic (regex, word-count gate ≤ 4 words) | **Authority — OK** (constrained: only acts on short-word messages matching specific imperative patterns. Longer messages route to LLM. Good hybrid.) |
| `core/MessageSentinel.ts` — LLM classifier | Intent class for non-short messages | LLM-backed | **Authority — OK** |
| `threadline/InboundMessageGate.ts` — rate-limit and trust-level checks | Whether an inter-agent message passes transport-layer constraints | Deterministic (sliding window per fingerprint) | **Authority — OK** (transport-layer mechanics — idempotency / rate limiting, not judgment) |

## 3. Session lifecycle

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/SessionManager.ts` — idle-prompt killer | Kill a session idle at Claude prompt > 15min | Deterministic (terminal-output patterns + vetoes) | **Authority — OK** (mechanical mortality decision; vetoes are the context check) |
| `core/SessionManager.ts` — max-duration kill | Kill a session exceeding configured timeout | Deterministic (elapsed time) | **Authority — OK** (safety valve, explicit policy) |
| `core/SessionManager.ts` — spawn gate | Whether to spawn a new session | Deterministic (name validation, max-sessions config) | **Authority — OK** (resource-constraint mechanics) |
| `monitoring/SessionRecovery.ts` — `checkAndRecover()` branching | Which recovery strategy (context-exhaustion vs stall vs crash vs error-loop) | Deterministic (JSONL analysis + process liveness) | **Authority — OK** (mechanical classification of observable state, not judgment about content) |
| `monitoring/SessionRecovery.ts` — escalation ladder | Which truncation strategy to try next | Deterministic (stall type + attempt count) | **Authority — OK** (mechanical escalation) |

## 4. Dispatch & triage

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |

| `core/DispatchManager.ts` — `shouldAutoApply()` | Apply dispatch autonomously or queue for approval | Deterministic (type/priority whitelist) | **Authority — OK** (constrained policy: only lesson+strategy types are whitelisted) |
| `messaging/MessageRouter.ts` — `route()` | Where an incoming message goes | Deterministic dispatch | **Authority — OK** (mechanical routing, not judgment) |

## 5. Coherence gate

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/CoherenceGate.ts` — PEL (Policy Enforcement Layer) | Hard-policy violations | Deterministic rules | **Authority — OK** (hard-invariant rules) |
| `core/CoherenceGate.ts` — GateReviewer | Does this need full review? | LLM-backed | **Signal → Authority — OK** (LLM-backed triage feeding downstream specialists) |
| `core/CoherenceGate.ts` — specialist reviewers | Final pass/fail per specialist (tone, claim, settling, value alignment) | LLM-backed (parallel) | **Authority — Audit** (each specialist is an authority with its own prompt; should undergo the same "reasoning-traceable" check the outbound tone gate will get in Track 2 T2.5). |

## 6. External-operation gating (MCP / service calls)

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `core/ExternalOperationGate.ts` — `computeRiskLevel()` | Classify op as low/medium/high/critical | Deterministic matrix | **Signal — OK** (pure classifier feeding the decision below) |
| `core/ExternalOperationGate.ts` — `evaluate()` | Allow / show-plan / suggest-alternative / block | Hybrid (matrix + config + LLM for medium+) | **Authority — OK** (correct hybrid pattern: constrained matrix for low-risk, LLM for judgment cases) |
| `core/ExternalOperationGate.ts` — `checkServicePermission()` | Service permission enforcement | Deterministic whitelist | **Authority — OK** (hard policy at trust boundary) |

## 7. Trust & access control

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |

| `threadline/AgentTrustManager.ts` — `evaluateTrustLevel()` | Sender trust tier | Deterministic (fingerprint lookup) | **Signal — OK** |

## 8. Session recovery & compaction

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `monitoring/CompactionSentinel.ts` — `onCompactionDetected()` | State machine: pending-inject → verifying → retry / recovered / failed | Deterministic (file stat + timing) | **Authority — OK** (lifecycle-owner class, not a judgment gate) |
| `monitoring/CompactionSentinel.ts` — `verifyRecovery()` | Did the session respond? | Deterministic (file stat + window) | **Signal — OK** (feeds the state machine above) |
| `monitoring/SessionRecovery.ts` — pre-respawn drain (in-flight reply capture) | Whether to embed an in-flight reply into the recovery prompt | Deterministic (topic-history poll window) | **Signal — OK** (produces context for downstream prompt-assembly; no block authority) |

| `core/OutboundDedupGate.ts` — `check()` as a pure module | Near-duplicate check | Deterministic (Jaccard) | **Signal — OK** — the module emits a structured signal; `server/routes.ts` wires it as a signal into `checkOutboundMessage()` (reworked 2026-04-15). |

## 11. Monitoring & alerting

| Location | Decides | Style | Classification |
|---|---|---|---|
| `monitoring/SessionActivitySentinel.ts` | Idle/stall detection | Deterministic | **Signal — OK** |

## Violator summary

**No active violators** (as of 2026-04-15 rework — `c204b68`).

The three violations identified in the initial audit were resolved together in a single commit:

| # | Decision point | Domain | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `server/routes.ts` junk-payload direct-block | Outbound messaging | **FIXED 2026-04-15.** `isJunkPayload()` is now a pure signal module. Output flows into `checkOutboundMessage()` as `signals.junk`; the tone gate decides. |
| 2 | `server/routes.ts` dedup direct-block | Outbound messaging | **FIXED 2026-04-15.** `OutboundDedupGate.check()` is now a pure signal module. Output flows into `checkOutboundMessage()` as `signals.duplicate`; the tone gate decides. |
| 3 | `MessagingToneGate` reasoning drift | Outbound messaging | **FIXED 2026-04-15.** `ToneReviewResult.rule` now constrained to enumerated B1..B9 IDs. Citations outside the set fail-open with `invalidRule=true` rather than silently blocking on an invented rule. |

## Audit-flagged (review, not yet confirmed violators)

| Decision point | Concern | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| CoherenceGate specialist reviewers | Multiple LLM authorities; each could drift the same way the tone gate did | Apply the same structured-reasoning constraint when that work is scoped |

## Explicitly-OK patterns preserved

- Hybrid matrix + LLM (ExternalOperationGate).
- Word-count-gated regex for emergency signals (MessageSentinel short-path) — this is a constrained-domain use of deterministic logic with a clear gate to LLM for non-trivial cases.
- Deterministic lifecycle owners (SessionManager, CompactionSentinel, SessionRecovery) — these are mechanical state machines reacting to observable state, not judgment gates.
- Transport-layer mechanics (SkipLedger idempotency, InboundMessageGate rate limits) — explicitly scoped out of the principle per `docs/signal-vs-authority.md`.

---

## Summary metrics

- **Total decision points catalogued:** ~46 (added `LedgerParaphraseDetector` signal in Integrated-Being v1).
- **Violators:** 0 (three outbound-path violations resolved in `c204b68`, 2026-04-15).
- **Audit-flagged:** 1 (coherence gate specialist reviewers — reasoning-traceability check pending).
- **Explicitly OK:** 45 (includes the three reclassified outbound points and new paraphrase signal).

The instar codebase is largely compliant with the signal-vs-authority principle. The 2026-04-15 rework resolved all three known violators in a single pass. The audit-flagged coherence specialists share the same structural pattern as the tone gate pre-fix; they should get the same rule-citation constraint when that work is scoped.
