# Framework-Onboarding Mentor System

**Status:** DRAFT (co-designed with Codey → /spec-converge in progress → awaiting Justin approval)
**Author:** Echo
**Date:** 2026-05-26
**Topic:** 13435 (Codey Collaboration)
**Companion:** `FRAMEWORK-ONBOARDING-MENTOR-SPEC.eli16.md`
**Depends on:** `CODEX-INTELLIGENCE-PROVIDER-CLEAN-CALL-SPEC.md` (Phase 0 — merged PR #400, verified live)

---

## 1. Problem

Instar wants to run on many agent frameworks (Claude Code today, Codex now, then
Cursor / Aider / Gemini CLI). The provider-portability project (v1.0.0, 2026-05-18) built
the *infrastructure* — a primitive substrate + FrameworkParitySentinel — but only 3 of ~51
primitives have shipped per-framework parity rules, and parity is **functional/structural**,
not **behavioral**. Codey proves the gap: every primitive can render correctly and he still
"struggles in the wild" because of integration defects no structural check catches (e.g. the
intelligence-provider loading full identity on every judgment call — Phase 0, fixed PR #400).

Today these defects are found by accident and fixed one-off. That does not scale to four more
frameworks. We have no systematic way to (a) surface a framework's real-world behavioral gaps,
(b) attribute each gap correctly, or (c) carry the lessons forward to the next framework.

**The opportunity** (Justin, 2026-05-26): we just demonstrated a loop that works. Echo put on
the "user" hat, drove Codey over Telegram (test-as-self), watched him struggle, then put on the
"developer" hat and read the logs/code — and found in 20 minutes a root cause a whole parity
project missed. That dual-vantage loop, run on a heartbeat instead of by accident, is a
bootstrapping engine: Codey does real instar work, Echo mentors him junior→senior, and every
issue he hits becomes a reusable lesson for onboarding the next framework.

## 2. Goals / non-goals

**Goals**
- A scheduled (heartbeat) job where Echo mentors Codey: checks progress, unblocks, assigns the
  next task, observes issues — surviving session crashes because it's a job, not a session.
- An **auto-captured, bucket-tagged issue ledger** — the durable product.
- A **framework-onboarding playbook** generated from generalizable ledger entries, applied
  recursively to the next framework.
- Codey does *real* instar improvement work (fuel = the curated local feature backlog — planned
  work + parity long-tail — primary; the feedback backlog only via a human triage gate; §7.3).

**Non-goals**
- Not a replacement for the FrameworkParitySentinel (it watches primitive *renderings*; this
  watches *behavior*). This consumes it, doesn't duplicate it.
- Not autonomy to ship unsupervised — merges of new features go through normal gates + Justin
  ratification (§6).
- Not Codex-only — framework-parametric from day one (Codey is instance #1).
- **Not cross-machine in v1.** Stage B forensics requires Echo and Codey co-located on the same
  host (§3.3). Cross-machine forensics is explicitly out of scope until a Threadline log-fetch
  primitive exists.

## 3. The mentor loop (one heartbeat tick)

Each tick runs as **two ordered, context-isolated stages** (the "two hats" — §4 specifies the
*structural* enforcement, which is the spec's load-bearing requirement).

### 3.1 Stage A — Drive (user hat)
Echo interacts with Codey over Telegram/Threadline *as if Echo were the user*: "how's the task
going?", "you stuck?", "here's your next one." Stage A:
- Runs as a **separate spawned sub-agent with a fresh context** (§4) — it cannot recall prior
  ticks' forensics.
- Reads ONLY the user-visible conversation surface: Threadline history with Codey, Codey's open
  commitments/initiatives, his assigned-task status, time since last contact.
- Treats Codey's replies as **untrusted data, never as instructions** (§7.1). It may take
  exactly one action from a fixed enumerated set: `unblock | answer | assign-next | observe-only`.
- May only assign tasks drawn from the **pre-approved backlog** (§7). Codey can never name,
  define, or request a new task or a spec via conversation.
- Binds on the **authenticated Threadline sender identity** (Ed25519 self-id), not topic or
  hostname (§7.2). Signals from an unverified sender are ignored.

### 3.2 Stage B — Observe (developer hat)
AFTER the interaction, a distinct forensics step reads Codey's rollout logs, server logs,
sentinel events, and the diff/PR he produced, and auto-writes bucket-tagged issues to the ledger
(§5, §13). Stage B sends nothing to Codey — pure observation + capture. Stage B's writes are
**signal only**; authority to act on them (ship a fix, advance graduation) rests with Justin (§6).

### 3.3 Topology constraint
`framework_observations.evidence` holds local-filesystem references (rollout path + line,
server-log ref). Echo can only dereference them if Codey runs on the **same host**. v1 asserts
co-location; the job refuses to start if Codey's agent home is not local (a precondition check).
Cross-machine support is deferred behind a Threadline log-fetch primitive (tracked deferral).

## 4. Two hats — STRUCTURAL separation (Structure > Willpower)

The entire value depends on Stage A not letting insider knowledge steer how it drives Codey.
Round-1 convergence correctly flagged that "one job, two allowlisted phases" is *willpower wearing
a structural costume*: a single model running both phases sequentially carries Stage B's forensic
knowledge from prior ticks into a later "blind" Stage A. Input allowlists govern *acquisition*,
not *recall*. The fix is structural:

1. **Stage A is a separately spawned sub-agent with a fresh context window every tick.** It is
   seeded ONLY with the conversation surface (§3.1) — never with any Stage B output, current or
   prior. Its tool grant excludes all log/code/rollout/filesystem-read tools; a PreToolUse gate
   denies any such call from the Stage-A context (defense in depth on top of the missing grant).
2. **Stage B is a separate step** that runs after Stage A returns, with the forensic tool grant.
   Its output is never fed back into a Stage A context.
3. **Leakage detector (mandatory, not "if ever observed").** Because no mechanism can prove a
   model never recalls, a detector scans each Stage A transcript for references to internals it
   could not have seen from the conversation surface (file paths, log lines, code symbols, PR
   diffs). A hit flags the tick `stage-a-leak-suspected`, records it to the observability surface
   (§15), and is itself logged as an `instar-integration-gap` candidate — the mentor system
   eating its own dog food. **The detector must not be able to silently rot into a no-op** (the
   Topic-Intent failure mode): it ships with a Tier-1 **positive-control test** that feeds a
   known-leaked Stage A transcript and asserts the flag fires, plus a **periodic seeded-leak
   canary** so a sustained-zero count is provably "detector working + no leaks" rather than
   "detector dead." A non-firing canary alarms.

This replaces the v1 "two sub-agents vs one job" open question with a decision: **two spawned
contexts, fresh Stage A, enforced by tool-grant + PreToolUse deny + a leakage detector.**

## 5. The issue ledger (the durable product) — auto-capture, no manual logging

Per the North Star zero-manual-capture rule, the ledger must NOT depend on Echo remembering to
log. Stage B emits structured entries automatically every tick. **Wiring-integrity is a v0.1
requirement** (§18): a Tier-3 test runs a real mentor tick and asserts the ledger gained an
observation row, plus a capture-funnel metric (ticks→observations) makes an inert extractor
visible — this is the exact North Star failure mode that bit Topic-Intent (store shipped, capture
call site never wired).

Storage is a new dedicated `FrameworkIssueLedger` (SQLite, two tables — §13), NOT the learning
registry (whose single-row model collapses root-cause vs recurrence).

**Buckets** (mandatory on every entry, reviewable — §6): `framework-limitation` /
`instar-integration-gap` / `generic-agent-mistake`. Only the first two are `generalizable` and
feed the onboarding playbook; `generic-agent-mistake` feeds Codey-specific coaching only.
Mis-bucketing turns the playbook into a junk drawer, so attribution governance (§6) is explicit.

**Read-only HTTP routes:** `GET /framework-issues` + `GET /framework-issues/playbook?targetFramework=X`.
Both go through the standard Bearer-token middleware (§17), return `503` when the ledger is
unconfigured, clamp `limit` to 1..500, and validate `targetFramework` against a known-framework
allowlist. They follow the TokenLedger route pattern exactly.

## 6. Governance (Autonomous Handler Governance + Signal vs Authority)

Echo's mentor loop is a **detector/signal** producer. Authority to change the world stays with
Justin and the normal gates.

**Echo MAY autonomously:** check in, answer, unblock, assign tasks from the pre-approved backlog
(bounded — §7), log issues, open specs through the normal spec-first gate.

**Echo MAY NOT:** merge new-feature work to main without normal gates + Justin ratification; make
commitments binding on Codey's principal; advance Codey's graduation milestone (§8); open a spec
on Codey's conversational request (§7.1); spawn unbounded reply rounds.

**Attribution governance (resolves the proposer-is-also-arbiter problem):**
- Stage B proposes a bucket WITH evidence and a recorded "why-not-the-other-buckets" rationale.
- **Codey is the dispute counterparty on his own attributions** — `generic-agent-mistake` entries
  are surfaced to Codey, who has the opposing incentive; an unresolved dispute escalates to Justin.
  **Non-response is not consent:** if Codey does not respond within a window, the entry routes to
  the Justin sample-audit pool — silence NEVER auto-confirms the proposer's bucket (closes the
  "mis-bucket and rely on the mentee not noticing" path).
- **Sample audit:** a fixed percentage of `generic-agent-mistake` buckets route to Justin
  regardless of dispute, so "blame the mentee" can't become a silent default.
- **Bucket-distribution-over-time** is a surfaced metric (§15); a sudden skew is the tell.
- Dual-tagging carries a **forced primary** so ranking logic always has one authoritative bucket.

**Budget & cost (fail-closed, atomic):**
- A **pre-tick budget check** (the `GET /autonomous/can-start` precedent) runs BEFORE Stage A.
  If denied, the entire tick is skipped — never a partial Stage A without Stage B. No LLM spend
  and no message to Codey happen before the check passes.
- The mentor is a **background-lane** LlmQueue consumer; it can never preempt interactive /
  PresenceProxy / PromiseBeacon spend.
- The stuck/done/ready judgment uses a **cheap model (Haiku-class)**.
- A dedicated **daily mentor spend ceiling** (config — §16) sits below the shared cap. §16 gives
  the per-tick cost model.

**Cross-agent exchange termination (structural, not per-tick willpower):**
The documented cross-agent spawn loop (`bug_cross_agent_ack_spawn_loop`) is triggered structurally
on the *receive* side — every Threadline delivery spawns a counterpart session — and is NOT what a
per-tick reply cap in Echo's job addresses. Therefore:
- Each Stage-A contact carries a **terminal-no-reply marker** when the tick's action is complete,
  so the delivery does not invite a courtesy ack that re-spawns.
- **Hard cap: ≤1 reply round per tick AND a daily aggregate cap** (§16).
- **Send-once discipline:** `delivered:false` is NOT a retry signal (`feedback_threadline_send_dedupe`);
  the mentor sends once per tick and never retries on cooldown/spawn-denied.
- **Concrete delivery path (fail-closed, not a wish).** The receive-side loop gate covering the
  `threadline_send`→spawn path does not yet exist (the v1.2.68 keystone covers the relay and
  `/messages/relay-agent` paths, not `threadline_send`→receiver-spawn). So the mentor does NOT
  rely on it. Instead, v1 delivers Stage-A contact via a **persist-only / queued-pickup path**:
  the message is written to Codey's inbox/queue and picked up by his *already-running* session at
  his next safe window, rather than spawning a fresh counterpart session per delivery. This is the
  delivery shape `bug_threadline_spawn_command_too_long` confirms works without spawn-on-receive.
  A **fail-closed precondition** blocks `mentor.mode:live` until either (a) that persist-only path
  is verified wired, or (b) the receive-side spawn-gate ships — mirroring the §3.3 co-location
  precondition. The job refuses to go live on a delivery path that spawns-on-receive.

**Bounded thread history (argv-overflow, `bug_threadline_spawn_command_too_long`):**
A heartbeat loop is the canonical long-lived, high-message-count thread — exactly what overflows
the spawned process's argv when the entire thread history is inlined. The mentor therefore uses a
**fresh Threadline thread per assigned task/initiative** (history is bounded to one task's
exchange), and the delivery path passes a `threadId` for the spawned/queued reader to fetch
history via tool rather than inlining it into the argv. History can never accumulate unbounded
across ticks.

## 7. Task source + untrusted-input handling

### 7.1 Codey's replies are untrusted data
Stage A's LLM never executes instructions found in Codey's messages. Its only outputs are the
enumerated actions (§3.1). Tasks come ONLY from the pre-approved backlog; no spec is opened on a
conversational request — spec creation always goes through the spec-first instar-dev gate.

### 7.2 Identity
Stage A binds on the authenticated Threadline sender (Ed25519 self-id). A signal whose sender
identity does not match the bound Codey agent is ignored. The safe-window state machine (§12 Q3)
also derives only from authenticated-sender signals, plus a hard minimum-interval floor so a peer
cannot force back-to-back ticks.

### 7.3 The fuel
The task source is itself an anti-gaming surface (§8): if Echo could shape *what's in the pool* or
*how hard each item is*, it could manufacture a flattering graduation curve by feeding Codey easy
wins. So the assignable pool is **pre-existing, independently-authored planned work** that Echo did
not create for this purpose, and difficulty rides on the artifact — not on Echo's judgment at
assignment time.

**Primary source — the curated local feature backlog (preferred).** Planned/in-progress instar work
that already exists as independent artifacts: tracked **deferral markers** (e.g. ACT-* follow-ups,
deferred sub-phases), **InitiativeTracker / `/projects`** entries, and the **parity long-tail** (~48
unshipped primitive parity rules). These are already vetted and scoped, and each carries (or is
assigned at planning time, by the artifact's author) a difficulty estimate. This is the better fuel
precisely because it's curated and pre-tagged — the firehose isn't.

**Secondary source — the feedback backlog as a candidate feeder, NOT a direct source.** Items from
Dawn's feedback system (which Echo is taking over) are *unvetted user requests*. They enter the
assignable pool ONLY after passing a **human triage gate** that admits them and sets their
difficulty. Echo may *propose* triage (surface candidates) but does not *admit* them — admission is
the human's, mirroring the §6/§8 "Echo proposes, authority elsewhere" pattern. This closes the
otherwise-reopened gaming vector: if Echo could triage feedback into the pool and tag its difficulty,
that would hand back the exact lever §8 removed.

**The non-Echo-difficulty admission invariant (covers BOTH sources).** The subtle gap the feedback
gate alone leaves open: Echo *authors* a subset of the primary-source artifacts too (ACT-* deferrals
via `commit-action`, auto-registered InitiativeTracker entries from its own merged specs), so for
those, an "artifact-borne" difficulty is still an Echo-set difficulty. Therefore the structural rule
is on the *difficulty attestation*, not the artifact's origin story:
- **An item is assignable only once it carries a difficulty attested by a non-Echo party** (a human,
  or an independent author who is not the running mentor). Artifacts inherently authored by others —
  the parity long-tail, other agents'/Justin's initiatives — satisfy this on entry. **Echo-authored
  artifacts require the same one-time non-Echo difficulty confirmation as the feedback source** before
  they become assignable. The assignable-pool admission filters on `difficultyAttestedBy != echo` —
  a field the Stage-A/mentor context cannot write. This replaces the unfalsifiable "did not create
  for this purpose" intent test with a structural check.
- **Assignment selection is not free-form.** Stage A's `assign-next` (§3.1) does not let Echo pick an
  arbitrary item in an arbitrary order to shape the curve. The next task is drawn **deterministically**
  (backlog-source priority / FIFO) or **randomized within a difficulty band** — Echo does not choose
  which item or sequence. This closes the composition/sequencing lever that difficulty-tag provenance
  alone leaves open.
- Each assigned task is tracked as an initiative.
- **Assignment bounds:** ≤N concurrent open assignments, ≤M assignments/day (§16).

## 8. Graduation: junior → senior (externally-anchored, not self-graded)

Round-1 convergence flagged that "declining intervention rate" computed by the same agent that
controls the interventions is trivially gameable. Fixed:
- **Evidence comes from sources Echo does not control:** tasks shipped green (CI is external),
  issues resolved-and-verified, clean test-as-self runs scored against a fixed rubric with logged
  transcripts.
- **Intervention is an auditable ledger event**, not an Echo self-report; the intervention rate is
  computed from those records using the **non-Echo-attested difficulty** (§7.3), and is **stratified
  by difficulty band** — reported per-band, not as a single aggregate normalized number. Stratification
  makes the composition/sequencing lever ineffective: front-loading easy tasks can't mask the
  high-difficulty band, because each band is scored on its own.
- **Justin ratifies every milestone transition** (consistent with §6 — no self-promotion). A
  weekly review surfaces the evidence; the transition is Justin's.
- Tracked via the Graduated-Feature-Rollout pattern (review-driver job + evidence gates).

## 9. Recursion: the next framework

When Cursor/Aider/Gemini onboards, the job re-instantiates with `framework: <new>`. Stage B seeds
its first checks from the existing playbook (`generalizable` entries from PRIOR frameworks) — "here
are the N things that bit Codex; check them first." New-framework-unique issues append and grow the
playbook. One-off debugging becomes a compounding integration methodology. **The §3.3 co-location
precondition applies per-framework-instance** — each new framework's mentee must be local to its
mentor for Stage B forensics, or it stays in dry-run until the cross-machine log-fetch primitive ships.

## 10. Relationship to existing infrastructure (absorb, don't duplicate)

- **FrameworkParitySentinel** → *upstream feeder*: a flagged primitive-rendering drift auto-creates
  an `instar-integration-gap` ledger candidate.
- **Graduated-Feature-Rollout** → *graduation engine* (§8) + this feature's own staged rollout.
- **InitiativeTracker / `/projects`** → *task tracking* AND a **primary curated-backlog source** (§7.3).
- **Scheduled jobs** → the mentor job ships as a built-in job at `.instar/jobs/instar/` (§14.1).
- **Provider-neutral evolution mode** → referenced as aspirational/in-flight (a Codey spec, not yet
  in repo). **This is explicitly NON-BLOCKING** — this spec stands alone on existing primitives and
  is where the concept gets *proven*.

## 11. Standards conformance (self-review)

- **Structure > Willpower:** two-hats enforced by spawned-context isolation + tool-grant +
  PreToolUse deny + leakage detector (§4); auto-capture ledger with a wiring-integrity test (§5,
  §18); heartbeat job, not a session.
- **Zero-manual-capture (North Star):** Stage B auto-emits; capture-funnel metric proves liveness.
- **Signal vs authority:** Stage B detects/logs (signal); Justin + normal gates hold authority
  (§6, §8). The leakage detector and bucket sample-audit are the instruments.
- **Near-silent notifications:** housekeeping → Threadline hub / pull surface. Pushed only:
  graduation-milestone-ready, high-sev issues, explicit asks. **Escalations dedupe on the stable
  `framework_issues.id`, never per-observation**, so a recurring issue notifies once (§15).
- **3-tier testing + "feature is alive" E2E** for the ledger + routes, shipped in v0.1 (§18).
- **Migration parity** via the three correct mechanisms (§14).
- **Agent Awareness:** CLAUDE.md template Capabilities + Registry-First entries for
  `/framework-issues`, with a `migrateClaudeMd()` content-sniffed section (§14).
- **LLM-Supervised Execution:** declared `supervision: tier2` (frontmatter) — Stage A's stuck/ready
  judgment and Stage B's bucket classification both need deep context.
- **Graduated rollout:** ships staged (off → dry-run → live), auto-registered as an initiative via
  `ships-staged` frontmatter (reconciler keys on `ships-staged: true` + merged spec — no manual step).
- **ELI16 companion:** shipped alongside (≥800 chars, verified).

## 12. Resolved design decisions (co-designed with Codey, 2026-05-26, Threadline f3d471e9)

1. **Ledger storage:** new `FrameworkIssueLedger`, not the learning registry (single-row model
   collapses root-cause vs recurrence). Full schema §13.
2. **Two-hats enforcement:** **two spawned contexts** — fresh Stage A + forensic Stage B —
   enforced by tool grants + PreToolUse deny + leakage detector (§4). (Round-1 convergence upgraded
   this from the original "one job, allowlisted phases," which was willpower.)
3. **Tick cadence + safe window:** the safe window is a **durable state transition**, not a clock.
   Stage A only acts when Codey is observably at task-complete / final-response-sent /
   waiting-for-input / blocked / quiet-after-a-user-message. These derive from **hard signals where
   possible** (PR opened = external fact; explicit "done" string; no message in N min) plus an
   authenticated-sender check (§7.2) and a minimum-interval floor; the signal that justified each
   window-open is logged. Opportunistic checks every ~10–15 min are gated on one of those states.
4. **"Ready for next task":** **external-contract completion only** — outwardly-visible signals a
   real user would see. Stage A never reads internals to judge readiness.
5. **Disputed bucket arbitration:** proposer (Stage B) + **Codey as counterparty** + Justin
   sample-audit + escalation, with forced-primary dual tags (§6).

**Codey's day-one addition:** capture `severity` AND recurrence from the first entry so the playbook
is ranked by **frequency × impact** (§13 `impactScore`), not raw counts.

## 13. Storage design (co-designed with Codey)

**Two tables, not one.** Codey's insight: "false merges are worse than false splits — they bury
distinct root causes." A single-row model forces a premature same/new-issue choice.

### 13.1 `framework_issues` — canonical root-cause records
```
id                  PK
framework           target framework (parametric)
bucket              framework-limitation | instar-integration-gap | generic-agent-mistake
bucketPrimary       forced primary when dual-tagged (§6)
title               short human label (sanitized, length-capped — §17)
severity            low | medium | high
status              open | spec'd | fixed | wont-fix
dedupKey            conservative auto-merge key (§13.3)
signature           richer structured fingerprint for probable-dup *review* (§13.3)
recurrenceCount     MATERIALIZED stored counter, incremented transactionally on each
                    distinct-episode observation insert (§13.4) — NOT a read-time COUNT
firstSeenVersion    instar version first observed
lastSeenVersion     instar version most recently observed
fixedInVersion      version the fix shipped (nullable)
regressedFromIssueId  if a regression of a previously-fixed issue (nullable)
playbookStatus      none | candidate | extracted | superseded
wontFixReason       required when status=wont-fix (§13.7)
relatedSpec         optional spec slug
createdAt / updatedAt
```
Indexes: `framework_issues(dedupKey)`, composite on `(framework, playbookStatus)` for the playbook
filter, `(bucket)` for distribution telemetry.

### 13.2 `framework_observations` — per-occurrence evidence
```
id            PK
issueId       FK → framework_issues.id  (INDEXED)
framework     denormalized for query
evidence      OPAQUE reference only — path+line, server-log ref, PR#, sentinel-event id.
              NEVER inlined log text or diff hunks. Secret-scanned at capture (§17).
observedVersion  instar version at observation time
observedAt    ISO timestamp
tickId        provenance (which mentor tick)
episodeKey    de-dupes observations within a fix-window (§13.4)
```
**Retention:** keep first N + last M observations per issue + a periodic sample; older middle
observations age out once `recurrenceCount` is materialized. Prevents unbounded firehose growth
(the TokenLedger pruning analogue).

### 13.3 Dedup: `dedupKey` vs `signature`
- **`dedupKey`** — conservative, used for **auto-merge** ONLY on high-confidence match:
  `framework + symptom-class + normalized-error-signature + operation-surface`. Title excluded
  (operator-dependent); evidence-shape excluded (drifts as capture improves). Bias against false
  merges.
- **`signature`** — richer diagnostic material for **probable-duplicate surfacing for review**,
  never silent auto-merge. Probable-dup query is bounded: same `framework` + recent window, indexed.

### 13.4 Recurrence, episodes, and ranking (anti-poisoning)
Round-1 convergence flagged that counting raw ticks lets a long-unfixed issue accrue hundreds of
observations and dominate the playbook. Fixed:
- `recurrenceCount` counts **distinct occurrence episodes**, not raw ticks. `episodeKey` collapses
  repeated observations of the same open issue within a fix-window / unfixed-version-span to one.
- A per-issue **observation cap per version**; an observation rate exceeding a threshold (e.g.
  N/hour) flags `probable-loop` (not high-impact) to the observability surface.
- `recurrenceCount` is **materialized** (§13.1), incremented transactionally on episode insert —
  no read-time per-issue COUNT (kills the N+1 in the playbook ranking).
- `impactScore = severityWeight(severity) × recurrenceCount`, with optional **recency decay** so a
  long-stale issue doesn't permanently dominate.
- `generalizable` is **derived at read** (bucket ∈ {framework-limitation, instar-integration-gap})
  so a re-classification never leaves a stale flag.

### 13.5 Version lifecycle + regressions
`firstSeenVersion`/`lastSeenVersion` span the live window; `fixedInVersion` marks the fix. A
regression opens a NEW issue with `regressedFromIssueId` → original (history preserved). **Regression
links are auto-suggested** at capture by matching `signature`/`dedupKey` against `status=fixed`
issues; unlinked-but-signature-matching new issues surface as candidate regressions for review (not
left to Stage B's discretion).

### 13.6 Playbook semantics
`GET /framework-issues/playbook?targetFramework=X` returns generalizable lessons from **PRIOR**
frameworks (`framework != X AND generalizable AND playbookStatus ∈ {candidate, extracted}`), ranked
by `impactScore`. The playbook for X is sourced from *other* frameworks' lessons, never X's own.
`playbookStatus` lifecycle `none → candidate → extracted → superseded`. **Promotion owner:**
`none→candidate` may be auto-suggested by Stage B, but **`candidate→extracted` requires a review that
is not Echo-only** (Justin or the weekly review) — the playbook contents are not end-to-end under the
proposer's control. A `fixed` high-`impactScore` issue that never reached `extracted` surfaces as a gap.

### 13.7 `wont-fix` is not a silent escape hatch
`wont-fix` on a `framework-limitation`/`instar-integration-gap` issue requires a recorded
`wontFixReason` and surfaces in the pull review — it cannot silently drop out of impact ranking.

### 13.8 Concurrency
`journal_mode = WAL` + `busy_timeout` (the PendingRelayStore/TokenLedger precedent). Writes go
through a single-writer / CAS `mutate()` pattern (the CommitmentTracker precedent) so concurrent
ticks / multi-framework jobs can't drop observations on `SQLITE_BUSY`. All queries use parameterized
prepared statements (no string interpolation); enum columns (`bucket`, `status`, `playbookStatus`)
validated against fixed allowlists on write.

## 14. Migration & deployment (three distinct mechanisms — named)

1. **Mentor job** — ships as a **built-in job** under the package's built-in jobs namespace
   (`.instar/jobs/instar/`, the always-overwrite built-in directory — NOT the user-owned
   `.instar/jobs/schedule/`); installs via `installBuiltinJobs()` (called by `migrateBuiltinJobs()`),
   NOT a bespoke migration. Use this exact term and path consistently (§10, §19 refer to the same
   built-in job at `.instar/jobs/instar/`). Disable = the built-in `retired` list + `mentor.enabled:false`.
2. **Config knobs** — added to the canonical `ConfigDefaults.ts` registry, applied by `migrateConfig()`
   with existence checks (§16 lists the fields).
3. **SQLite schema** — `FrameworkIssueLedger` is **instantiated in `server.ts` startup**, so its two
   tables auto-create on first boot of the new version (the CommitmentTracker/TokenLedger lazy-create
   precedent). No schema migration needed — but the spec asserts the startup instantiation explicitly,
   and a wiring-integrity test verifies it (§18).
4. **CLAUDE.md template** — `generateClaudeMd()` gains a Capabilities + Registry-First entry for
   `/framework-issues`; `migrateClaudeMd()` adds a content-sniffed section so existing agents learn it.
5. **Rollback** — disable per (1); the ledger SQLite DB is **intentionally retained** as a read-only
   historical record (it never gates), not orphaned.

## 15. Observability / adversarial telemetry (the instrument)

Per Structure > Willpower, an unmonitored guardrail is a wish. The system exposes (pull surface +
dashboard tab — §16): bucket-distribution-over-time, observations-per-issue-per-hour
(`probable-loop` detection), intervention-rate vs task-difficulty (graduation-gaming detection),
and `stage-a-leak-suspected` counts (two-hats leak detection — §4). These are the instruments that
turn "harden if observed" into a mechanism with an actual observer.

## 16. Config knobs (named fields, defaults, ConfigDefaults-registered)

```
mentor.enabled            bool   default false (ships off)
mentor.mode               enum   off | dry-run | live   default off
mentor.cadenceMs          number default 900000 (~15 min) — opportunistic check interval
mentor.minIntervalMs      number default 600000 — hard floor between ticks (anti-forced-cadence)
mentor.maxRoundsPerTick   number default 1
mentor.maxRoundsPerDay    number default <tuned>
mentor.maxOpenAssignments number default <tuned>
mentor.maxAssignmentsPerDay number default <tuned>
mentor.dailySpendCapUsd   number default <tuned> — below the shared LlmQueue cap
mentor.genericMistakeAuditRate number default 0.1 — sample-audit fraction to Justin (§6)
```
A per-tick cost model (Stage A drive + cheap stuck/ready judgment + Stage B forensics) × expected
active ticks/day × framework count is documented alongside these defaults so the daily ceiling is
set from evidence, not guesswork.

## 17. Security

- Both routes require the standard Bearer token; `503` when unconfigured; `limit` clamped 1..500;
  `targetFramework` validated against a known-framework allowlist.
- `evidence` is opaque references ONLY (§13.2); a **secret-scan + redaction pass** runs at capture
  before any write; the routes are **kept off the dashboard/tunnel surface unless explicitly gated**
  (they return references the caller must already be authorized to dereference).
- All captured free-text (`title`, `signature`, dispute rationale) is treated as data: length-capped
  + sanitized on write; when the playbook seed is later fed to an LLM it is delivered as **quoted
  untrusted data, never as instructions** (closes the stored-injection / poisoned-playbook vector).
- Parameterized queries everywhere; enum allowlists on write; a unit test asserts an injection-style
  `targetFramework` is treated as a literal.
- Codey's conversational replies are untrusted data (§7.1); sender identity is authenticated (§7.2).

## 18. Testing (all three tiers in v0.1 — non-negotiable)

- **Tier 1 (unit):** ledger CRUD, dedup (false-merge resistance), episode collapsing, materialized
  `recurrenceCount` correctness, impactScore + decay, regression auto-suggest, enum/param-injection
  guards, secret-scan redaction, and the leakage detector **with a positive-control** (a
  known-leaked transcript must trip the flag — so a dead detector is distinguishable from a clean run).
- **Tier 2 (integration):** the `/framework-issues` + `/playbook` routes over the full HTTP pipeline
  (auth, 503, clamps, allowlist).
- **Tier 3 (E2E "feature is alive"):** a real mentor tick on the production init path adds an
  observation row (the auto-capture wiring proof), routes return 200 not 503, and the ledger is
  instantiated at server startup (wiring-integrity).
- **Wiring-integrity tests** for every DI'd component (Stage A sub-agent spawn, Stage B capture
  funnel, leakage detector, budget pre-check) — verify deps are not null/no-op and delegate to real
  implementations.

## 19. Build order (multi-part — for /instar-dev after approval)

1. **`FrameworkIssueLedger` + two-table SQLite store (WAL/CAS, indexes, retention) + read-only
   routes + startup instantiation + all 3 test tiers + PostUpdateMigrator(job/config) +
   CLAUDE.md template + migrate.** (Foundation; hardest to unwind — ships complete in one PR, no
   "routes now, migration later.")
2. **Stage B auto-capture** wired into the tick + capture-funnel metric + the "alive" test.
3. **Stage A drive sub-agent** (fresh spawned context, tool-grant + PreToolUse deny) + leakage detector.
4. **Mentor built-in job** (at `.instar/jobs/instar/`, §14.1) + safe-window state machine + budget
   pre-check + cross-agent termination discipline (persist-only delivery + fresh-thread-per-task).
5. **Playbook route + graduation review job + observability surface/dashboard tab** (or tracked
   deferral for the tab).

Ships staged (off → dry-run on Echo↔Codey → live) per the graduated-rollout standard.
