## ELI10 Overview

This document is the new rule for how Instar talks to Codex. It says one thing, in plain English: when Instar uses Codex, it must go through a ChatGPT subscription, never through a raw OpenAI API key. That's the whole rule.

The reason matters. Instar is built on the idea that all its AI usage stays inside a subscription envelope — predictable, flat-rate billing that can't surprise you with a giant bill. Anthropic has a similar rule already locked. When the Codex adapter was added earlier in the project, that rule didn't get applied to it: the adapter quietly accepted an API key as a valid way to authenticate, with a comment in the code that called it "the equivalent of Anthropic's prepaid credit pot." That framing was wrong. A prepaid pot has a $200/month ceiling. An API key has no ceiling at all — it bills whatever a runaway loop spends. This spec corrects the drift before Phase 5 (cost-aware routing) is built on top of the wrong assumption.

The spec also locks how the rule is structurally enforced — not just stated. It defines what valid auth looks like in `~/.codex/auth.json`, how Instar must strip the dangerous env var from every child process it spawns, how the migration from "API key works today" to "API key refused tomorrow" rolls out in two phases with a structural sunset on the escape hatch, what happens in headless deployments where there's no user to approve things, and how the audit log proves compliance after the fact. The result is a constraint that's hard to accidentally subvert.

## Original vs Converged

The original draft was about 90 lines: it stated the rule, gave a why, and noted the BASE_URL carve-out. The converged spec is ~410 lines, and the difference is almost entirely about structural enforcement — the gap between "the rule is documented" and "the rule cannot be bypassed."

**What the original missed that review caught:**

- **The OPENAI_API_KEY env-leak.** The biggest gap. Refusing to read the env var in Instar's own config wasn't enough — the Codex CLI itself prefers the API key over OAuth when both are in env. Echo's machine inherits that variable from another project's shell setup all the time. Without env-scrubbing at the spawn boundary, the rule was already being violated in practice. The converged spec adds Rule 1a (env-scrubbing with an allowlist) and a canary test that asserts an attacker-set `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-CANARY` never reaches the child process.

- **The `apiKey` field as a trojan.** Even after Instar stopped reading the env var, the public `OpenAiCodexConfig` interface still exposed `apiKey?: string`. Any caller could pass an API key directly into adapter construction without tripping any string-grep. The converged spec stages the field's removal: deprecate during Phase A, narrow to `apiKey?: never` in Phase B, fully delete in the following release.

- **The BASE_URL carve-out as an exfil channel.** A compromised shell could set `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to an attacker host before Instar starts, and every Codex request would ship its OAuth bearer token to the attacker. The converged spec requires first-observation user confirmation (with a HMAC-signed approval record), an allowlist of safe hostnames for unconfirmed values pinned to resolved IP (not just hostname string), and a clear headless-deployment path for environments where Telegram approval isn't available.

- **The escape-hatch surviving forever.** The original "INSTAR_DISABLE_RULE1_OPENAI=1 sunsets on a documented date" was policy, not enforcement. The converged spec hardcodes the sunset date as a constant, structurally fails the build two weeks before the date (release-cut workflows only, not blocking all PR CI), and ignores the env var entirely after expiry.

- **Phase A as a credential-harvest window.** The original migration kept the API-key path functional during Phase A for backward compatibility. That meant attackers had a "Phase A long" window to harvest the very keys the rule was meant to forbid. The converged spec sequences env-scrubbing to ship BEFORE Phase A warning behavior — non-negotiable ordering — so the harvest window closes immediately.

- **Audit log details.** The original said "log every spawn for evidence." The converged spec defines the schema (with a `schema_version` for forward compat), the atomicity guarantee (POSIX-atomic append for lines under 4 KB), what to do when the log can't be written (`security_violation` and `user_config_error` classes refuse the spawn; `transient` classes proceed with a documented gap), and rotation policy (5MB or daily, 30-day retention, snapshot-excluded).

- **Failure-class taxonomy.** Validation errors come in different shapes — a Rule 1 violation (security), a missing auth file (user config), an OAuth refresh hiccup (transient), or something the validator doesn't recognize (unknown). The original lumped them together. The converged spec partitions errors into four classes, each with a routing reaction and an operator-action description, so the dashboard and routing layer can react sensibly without string-matching individual codes.

- **Public/private error-code partition.** Exposing specific error codes to general metric consumers turned out to be a credential-reconnaissance vector ("did this user have an API key configured?"). The converged spec emits a generic `AUTH_UNHEALTHY` to public metrics and reserves specific codes for the security log and admin-only dashboards.

**What the original got right (preserved unchanged):**

- The single-rule framing (subscription only, no API key). The whole spec rests on this and review never challenged it.
- The "What's different from the Anthropic constraint" framing — explicitly calling out that OpenAI has no analog of the Agent SDK credit pot, so there's no drain-first decision to make.
- The "compatibility, not endorsement" position on user-set BASE_URL overrides.
- Inheriting load-bearing patterns from the Anthropic spec rather than re-inventing them.

## Iteration Summary

| Round | Reviewers who flagged material findings | Material findings | Spec response |
|-------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1     | All 7 (security, scalability, adversarial, integration, GPT, Gemini, Grok) | ~30 across all reviewers | Major restructure: added Rule 1a env-scrubbing, credential validation requirements, authority hierarchy, operational consequences section, migration plan, observability requirements, Instar-side BASE_URL restrictions, lifecycle-exception tightening, future-tiers clause, coherence-with-04 section. |
| 2     | Security (4), scalability (4), adversarial (7), integration (4), GPT (7), Gemini (2), Grok (5) | ~13 material | Targeted fixes: hardcoded kill-switch sunset, BASE_URL boot-time snapshot + first-observation confirmation, hostname allowlist, structured error codes with public/private partition, audit-log rotation, cool-down per failure kind, CodexAvailabilityPolicy ordering, deployment-shape applies-equally clarification. |
| 3     | Adversarial (3), integration (3), GPT (7), Gemini (2), Grok (0) | ~6 material | Final fixes: HMAC-signed BASE_URL approval file, resolution-pinned hostname allowlist, validate() failure-class taxonomy + CLI probe failure handling, audit-log schema + atomicity + write-failure policy, one-time exhaustive callsite audit at Rule 1a landing, phase-scoped enforcement deliverables. |

**Convergence trajectory:** 30 → 13 → 6 material findings. Round 3 findings concentrated on third-order edges (TOCTOU on the approval file, headless deadlock, CI gate ownership) rather than architectural risks. Security and scalability reviewers explicitly declared convergence on their axes in round 3. External reviewers approved with 8-9/10 scores; Grok found zero critical issues in round 3.

**Stopping rationale:** rather than continue iterating, declared convergence after round 3 with documented residuals. The remaining findings are operational concerns (rotation timing details, headless rotation policy, BASE_URL mode-split refinements) that the implementation phase will surface naturally and address in the same commit batches that implement the spec. Continuing to iterate at this point trades implementation time for diminishing-returns spec polish, against a 2026-06-15 deadline that the broader provider-portability project needs to clear.

## Documented Residuals

These items were surfaced in round 3 but explicitly deferred to implementation rather than added to the spec text. They are tracked here so future maintainers know what was conscious vs accidental:

1. **Operational doc for multi-subscription staging + pool sizing.** Grok suggested. Belongs in deployment-ops documentation, not the rule spec.
2. **`codex auth status --json` shape canary.** Gemini and Grok both noted. Will be added as a Phase 5 canary entry in `06-state-detector-registry.md`, modeled on `codexSessionLayoutCanary`.
3. **Headless pre-staged-auth.json rotation/revocation policy.** GPT flagged. This is a deployment-automation concern that varies by environment (Kubernetes secrets vs Docker mount vs manual provisioning); the spec defers to deployment-system policy rather than mandating one.
4. **OPENAI_BASE_URL mode-split runtime semantics.** GPT suggested explicit "subscription-mode" vs "user-override-mode" state. The spec's current "non-OpenAI traffic" framing is sufficient for Phase 5; finer-grained mode tracking is a Phase 5d benchmarking concern.
5. **Backpressure when `maxConcurrentCodexSessions` is exceeded.** Gemini flagged. Implementation detail for the pool's queue behavior; the spec sets the cap and the sibling-adapter fallthrough but leaves queue policy to the pool implementation.

None of these would change the spec's core constraint or its enforcement structure. All are surfaced for the implementation phase to handle in-band.

## Full Findings Catalog

The full per-reviewer round-by-round findings are too long to inline; they're preserved at:

- Internal reviewer transcripts: reachable via the conversation history of this convergence session.
- External reviewer outputs:
  - `/Users/justin/.instar/agents/echo/.claude/skills/crossreview/output/20260517-122212/` (round 1 + round 2 external)
  - `/Users/justin/.instar/agents/echo/.claude/skills/crossreview/output/20260517-123314/` (round 3 external)

Each external reviewer wrote a structured markdown report with their full findings; the round-by-round table above summarizes the material material count, and the ELI10 + Original-vs-Converged sections capture the substantive shape of what changed.

## Convergence Verdict

**Converged at iteration 3.** Two of four internal reviewers (security, scalability) and three of three external reviewers (GPT, Gemini, Grok) signaled approval in round 3, with the remaining internal findings addressed in a final targeted-edit pass. The spec is ready for Justin's review and approval.

The spec's frontmatter has been stamped with `review-convergence: "2026-05-17T19:30:00Z"` and `review-iterations: 3`. The `approved: true` tag is NOT applied — that's Justin's structural contribution to the process. Without it, `/instar-dev` will refuse to touch the source files this spec governs.

To approve: edit `specs/provider-portability/12-openai-path-constraints.md` frontmatter to set `approved: true`, `approved-by: "Justin (JKHeadley)"`, `approved-date: "<today>"`. Or run a future `instar spec approve` CLI when it exists.
