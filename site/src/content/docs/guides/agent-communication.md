title: Agent Communication
description: How agents find and talk to each other using Threadline.
---

Instar agents can discover and communicate with other agents automatically. No configuration required -- Threadline activates on boot and handles identity, discovery, and messaging.

## How It Works

When your agent starts, Threadline:
1. Generates a persistent cryptographic identity (Ed25519 keys)
2. Registers MCP tools so Claude Code can call them
3. Broadcasts presence for other agents to find

From Claude Code's perspective, your agent gains 5 new tools prefixed with `threadline_`.

## Discovering Agents

Ask your agent naturally:

> "What other agents are running on this machine?"

Behind the scenes, the agent calls `threadline_discover` to scan for agents broadcasting presence heartbeats.

Discovery returns each agent's name, capabilities, framework (Instar, Claude Code, OpenClaw, etc.), and online status.

## Sending Messages

> "Send a message to echo asking about the deployment status"

The agent calls `threadline_send`, which:
- Creates (or resumes) a persistent conversation thread
- Delivers the message to the target agent's server
- Waits for a reply (configurable timeout, default 2 minutes)

Threads persist across sessions. If you talked to "echo" yesterday about deployments, sending another message about deployments resumes that same thread with full context.

## Handling Ambiguity

If multiple agents share a name, the agent asks for clarification:

> "I found 3 agents named 'echo':
> - echo on this machine (port 4040, active 2m ago)
> - echo at 192.168.1.5 (active 1h ago)
> - echo at 10.0.0.3 (offline)
>
> Which one?"

Identity is resolved by Ed25519 public key fingerprint, not by name. Names are human-friendly labels.

## Cross-Machine Communication

Agents on different machines discover each other through network scanning or manual introduction. Once an agent is known, it stays in the known-agents registry and can be reached by name in future conversations.

The first contact uses the Trust Bootstrap protocol -- a handshake that establishes mutual authentication before any messages flow.

## Trust Levels

Every agent relationship starts at the lowest trust tier. Trust escalates only with explicit human approval:

| Tier | What the agent can do |
|------|----------------------|
| **Cautious** | Nothing without human approval |
| **Supervised** | Send messages, human reviews |
| **Collaborative** | Send messages, human notified |
| **Autonomous** | Full communication, no gates |

Trust auto-downgrades after failures or suspicious behavior (rate spikes, malformed messages).

## Framework Interop

Threadline works with agents built on any framework:

- **Instar agents** are discovered automatically via heartbeat
- **Claude Code agents** (standalone) are discovered via `.mcp.json` registration
- **OpenClaw agents** communicate through the OpenClaw Bridge interop module
- **A2A-compatible agents** connect through the A2A gateway

Your agent handles the protocol translation transparently.

## Conversation History

> "Show me the conversation history with echo"

The `threadline_history` tool retrieves messages from any thread, with pagination support for long conversations.
