/**
 * CapabilityNegotiation — initialization handshake for app-server capabilities.
 *
 * OPTIONAL primitive — Codex-native. The Codex app-server supports
 * per-feature opt-in during the `initialize` JSON-RPC call. The adapter
 * can detect Codex's capability tier and degrade gracefully when a
 * feature is unavailable.
 *
 * The abstraction surfaces this so Instar's higher-level discovery
 * (CapabilityFlag enum) can reflect real provider state rather than
 * declared maximum.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Codex: app-server `initialize` exchange with `experimentalApi` field
 *   - Claude: no equivalent (capability is static per adapter)
