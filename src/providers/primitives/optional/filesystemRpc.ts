/**
 * FilesystemRpc — drive file mutations through the provider's sandbox.
 *
 * OPTIONAL primitive — Codex-native. A host process can read/write/watch/copy
 * files via the agent's sandbox rather than touching the filesystem
 * directly. Useful when the host wants its operations to obey the same
 * sandbox rules as the agent's.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Codex: `fs/readFile`, `fs/writeFile`, `fs/watch`, `fs/copy` JSON-RPC
 *     methods on the app-server
 *   - Claude: no equivalent
