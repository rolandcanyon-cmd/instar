/**
 * NotificationOptOut — declare which event notifications the client doesn't want.
 *
 * OPTIONAL primitive — Codex-native. Reduces JSON-RPC chatter when the
 * client only cares about specific event types. Useful for high-volume
 * tailing operations where most events would be discarded anyway.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Codex: app-server `initialize` with `optOutNotificationMethods` array
 *   - Claude: no equivalent — Claude emits hook events to all configured
 *     receivers regardless
