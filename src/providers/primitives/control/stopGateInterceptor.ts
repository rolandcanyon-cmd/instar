/**
 * StopGateInterceptor — intercept the provider's "I'm about to stop" signal,
 * decide whether to let it stop or continue with a follow-up prompt.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude: Stop hook event with `decision: 'block', reason: '...'`
 *     response continues the session
 *   - Codex: same — Stop hook returning `{"decision":"block","reason":"..."}`
 *     produces a continuation prompt (intentionally Claude-compatible)
 *
 * Used by Instar's existing UnjustifiedStopGate to keep sessions running
 * when they prematurely declare "I'm done" but there's clearly more to do
 * (plan files not finished, tests not run, etc.).
 *
 * The interceptor is registered with the provider via the HookEventReceiver
 * primitive (Stop event kind). This primitive provides the higher-level
 * decision API; underneath, an adapter uses HookEventReceiver to subscribe
 * to Stop events and reply with the decision.
