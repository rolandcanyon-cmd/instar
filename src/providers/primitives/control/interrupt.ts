/**
 * Interrupt — cancel an in-flight model turn without ending the session.
 *
 * Distinct from HardKill (which ends the entire session) and from
 * AbortError on the start call (which can only interrupt at start). This
 * primitive interrupts the model mid-generation — the session continues
 * and accepts new input, but the current turn is abandoned.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude tmux session: send Ctrl-C via tmux send-keys; the REPL
 *     interrupts the current generation and returns to the idle prompt
 *   - Codex app-server: `turn/interrupt` JSON-RPC method
 *   - Codex CLI process: SIGINT (not as clean — process may exit)
 *
 * Used by:
 *   - Stall triage (interrupt a stuck tool call, let user re-prompt)
 *   - User-initiated cancellation in long-running sessions
 *   - StopGateInterceptor refusals that need to actually stop generation
 *
 * Implementations MUST leave the session in an usable state after
 * interrupt. If the provider's interrupt mechanism is destructive (kills
 * the session), the adapter MUST report `supportedKind === 'non-destructive'`
 * as `false` so consumers can decide.
