/**
 * TimeoutBound — enforce a maximum wall-clock duration on a session.
 *
 * Distinct from per-call timeouts (which are part of CancellationOptions
 * on individual primitive methods). This primitive enforces a session-level
 * deadline: after N minutes of wall-clock time, the session is hard-killed
 * regardless of state.
 *
 * Used by Instar's existing `maxDurationMinutes` mechanism on jobs and
 * spawned sessions. Provides a safety ceiling so a runaway agent can't
 * consume unbounded resources.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude: instar enforces externally (no native Claude support today)
 *   - Codex: per-subagent `job_max_runtime_seconds`; for top-level sessions
 *     instar enforces externally
 *
 * Both providers lack native session-level timeouts today, so most
 * adapters implement this by tracking session start time and triggering
 * HardKill at the deadline.
