/**
 * IdleBound — kill or restart a session that's been idle too long.
 *
 * Distinct from TimeoutBound (which enforces total wall-clock duration).
 * IdleBound triggers when the session has been waiting at the idle prompt
 * (no model activity, no input) for longer than N minutes.
 *
 * Used by Instar's existing `idlePromptKillMinutes` on SessionManager.
 * Prevents unbounded session accumulation when an agent finishes early
 * but the session is left running.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude: external watchdog detects idle marker in tmux capture-pane
 *     and kills the session
 *   - Codex: app-server `thread/idle` notifications + external watchdog
 *   - Both: NEITHER has native idle-timeout config (capability flag
 *     `NativeIdleBound` is false for both adapters); the primitive
 *     wraps external enforcement
