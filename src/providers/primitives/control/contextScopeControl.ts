/**
 * ContextScopeControl — control what context the session loads at startup.
 *
 * Providers automatically load instruction files (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md)
 * and settings from various scopes (user-global, project, current-dir).
 * Sometimes callers want to exclude project context (e.g., for
 * lightweight classification calls that shouldn't pick up the agent's
 * personality).
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude: `--setting-sources` CLI flag (e.g., `user` to exclude
 *     project CLAUDE.md). The existing ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider
 *     uses this to keep judgment calls clean.
 *   - Codex: `project_doc_max_bytes`, `project_doc_fallback_filenames`,
 *     `trusted-project gating` in config.toml. AGENTS.md cascade is
 *     root→cwd with override files (richer than Claude's monolithic).
 *
 * Asymmetric on cascade semantics: Claude has a flat priority (project >
 * user > builtin), Codex has a layered cascade. The abstraction presents
 * a uniform `scopes: ('builtin' | 'user' | 'project' | 'directory')[]`
 * include-list; adapters translate.
