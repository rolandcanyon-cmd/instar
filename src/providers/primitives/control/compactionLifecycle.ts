/**
 * CompactionLifecycle — observe and respond to context compaction.
 *
 * As a session grows long, the provider's context window fills and the
 * agent needs to compact. Some providers emit a PreCompact hook event
 * (Claude); others compact silently when a threshold is reached (Codex).
 * The abstraction presents a uniform "pre-compact" observation point so
 * consumers can persist resumption state regardless of provider.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude: PreCompact hook event + /tmp/claude-session-<id>/compacting
 *     marker file. Capability flag `PreCompactHook` is true.
 *   - Codex: auto-compact at `effective_window - 13k` tokens; no hook
 *     event. Adapter SYNTHESIZES the pre-compact signal by polling
 *     `turn.completed.usage.context_window_used` and emitting the
 *     observation when crossing a threshold. Capability flag
 *     `PreCompactHook` is false; the synthesized notice is best-effort.
 *
 * Used by Instar's existing CompactionSentinel + SessionMigrator. Lets
 * sessions emit their working state to a resume payload before the
 * compaction happens, so the next round picks up cleanly.
