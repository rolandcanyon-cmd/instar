/**
 * IntelligenceCallQueue — quota-aware concurrent LLM dispatch.
 *
 * Sits between application modules that need LLM access and the underlying
 * OneShotCompletion / StructuredOneShot primitives. Coordinates:
 *   - Concurrency limits (don't run more than N in parallel against the
 *     same provider quota)
 *   - Deduplication (collapse identical in-flight requests)
 *   - Batching (when the provider supports request bundling)
 *   - Daily/weekly spend caps (refuse calls above a budget threshold)
 *   - Per-tier rate limits (Haiku separate from Sonnet pool)
 *   - AbortSignal coordination across modules
 *
 * Instar's existing `LlmQueue` is the in-tree consumer of this pattern;
 * primitives like PresenceProxy, PromiseBeacon, StallTriageNurse all
 * compete for the same provider quota and need this coordination.
 *
 * This primitive is provider-agnostic; the queue logic doesn't depend on
 * which provider is underneath. The provider abstraction surfaces it so
 * that routing policies can use it as the actual dispatch point rather
 * than calling primitives directly.
