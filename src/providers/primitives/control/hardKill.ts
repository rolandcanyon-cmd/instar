/**
 * HardKill — force-terminate a session.
 *
 * The nuclear option: stop the session NOW regardless of state. For
 * graceful shutdown, use the transport primitive's native close/retire/end
 * method instead. HardKill is for unresponsive sessions, runaway loops,
 * security responses, and emergency cleanup.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude tmux session: `tmux kill-session -t <session>`
 *   - Codex CLI process: SIGTERM then SIGKILL escalation
 *   - Codex app-server: `thread/closed` after `turn/interrupt` if needed
 *
 * Implementations SHOULD attempt graceful kill first (SIGTERM equivalent)
 * and escalate to forceful kill (SIGKILL equivalent) after a short grace
 * period. The escalation is implementation-specific; consumers see only
 * "session is gone."
