/**
 * InputInjection — send input to a running session mid-flight.
 *
 * For interactive REPL sessions, this is how instar injects prompts after
 * the session has started. The transport primitives establish the session;
 * this control primitive feeds it.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude tmux session: `tmux send-keys -t <session> -l "<text>"` + Enter
 *   - Codex app-server: `turn/steer` JSON-RPC method
 *   - Codex CLI in tmux: same tmux send-keys pattern
 *
 * Composes with WarmSessionInbox (which provides a structured inbox channel
 * — preferred for portability) and AgenticSessionRpc (which has native
 * `steerTurn`). InputInjection is the lower-level primitive used by
 * adapters internally and exposed for direct use when needed.
