/**
 * HookEventReceiver — receive provider-emitted lifecycle hook events.
 *
 * Providers that support hook scripts (Claude Code, Codex CLI) can be
 * configured to POST event payloads to an HTTP endpoint as they reach
 * specific lifecycle points. Instar receives these via the
 * HookEventReceiver primitive.
 *
 * Asymmetric across providers:
 *   - Claude Code: 10+ hook event types (PostToolUse, SubagentStart,
 *     SubagentStop, Stop, WorktreeCreate, WorktreeRemove, TaskCompleted,
 *     SessionEnd, PreCompact, InstructionsLoaded, UserPromptSubmit)
 *   - Codex: 6 hook event types (SessionStart, PreToolUse, PostToolUse,
 *     PermissionRequest, UserPromptSubmit, Stop). Notably lacks Subagent
 *     and PreCompact events.
 *
 * The abstraction exposes a union of all known event kinds with explicit
 * per-event capability flags. Consumers can check `supportedEventKinds()`
 * to discover what the current provider actually emits.
 *
 * For events the provider doesn't natively emit (Codex's lack of
 * SubagentStart, e.g.), the adapter MAY synthesize them from other
 * signals (Codex app-server `thread/started` notifications). When it
 * does, set `synthesized: true` on the emitted event.
 *
 * Mapping intentionally compatible: Codex's hook return contract (JSON
 * stdin/stdout, exit code 2 semantics) is deliberately Claude-compatible.
