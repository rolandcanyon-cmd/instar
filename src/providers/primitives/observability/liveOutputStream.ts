/**
 * LiveOutputStream — real-time observation of a session's output.
 *
 * Provides a snapshot or tail of the session's live output buffer at any
 * point during its execution. Used for: dashboards, watchdog detection,
 * stall triage, debugging.
 *
 * Distinct from the session's `events` stream (which is structured) — this
 * is the raw output as the user/agent sees it. For tmux-based providers,
 * this is `capture-pane` output. For pure-API providers, it's the
 * concatenation of message deltas plus tool I/O.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude tmux session: `tmux capture-pane -t <session> -p -S -N`
 *   - Codex CLI process: stdout/stderr capture
 *   - Codex app-server: subscribe to item.*.delta notifications and assemble
