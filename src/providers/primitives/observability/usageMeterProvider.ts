/**
 * UsageMeterProvider — query provider's authoritative usage/quota state.

 * accounting. Distinct from per-call `UsageReport` (which describes a
 * single completion) — this primitive answers "where do I stand on my
 * subscription limits / API quotas right now?"
 *
 * Asymmetric across providers:
 *   - Anthropic: public OAuth usage API (`GET /api/oauth/usage`,
 *     `GET /api/oauth/profile`). Capability flag `PublicUsageApi` is true.
 *   - Codex: no documented public quota endpoint. Internal
 *     `/backend-api/wham/usage` (undocumented, unstable) and
 *     `account/rateLimits/read` JSON-RPC method on the app-server.
 *     Capability flag `PublicUsageApi` is false; the adapter SHOULD fall
 *     back to local accounting (sum `turn.completed.usage` per call) when
 *     no authoritative source is available.
 *
 * Callers who care about exact billable spend MUST check `isAuthoritative`
 * before trusting the data. Estimated/local-accounting data is still
 * useful for "are we near the cap?" decisions.
