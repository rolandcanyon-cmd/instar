/**
 * ConversationLogReader — post-hoc read of a provider's session log.
 *
 * Distinct from `LiveOutputStream` (which captures terminal-level output
 * including UI chrome) and `ConversationLogTailer` (which watches the log
 * file for new entries in real time). This primitive is for going BACK
 * into a finished or in-flight session's history — replay, analysis,
 * inspection.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude: read `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-path>/<uuid>.jsonl`
 *   - Codex: read `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-<ts>-<uuid>.jsonl`
 *
 * The structural format differs between providers (Claude's flat-by-UUID
 * vs. Codex's date-partitioned with SQLite index), but the abstraction
 * presents a uniform "give me this session's history as an event sequence"
 * interface.
