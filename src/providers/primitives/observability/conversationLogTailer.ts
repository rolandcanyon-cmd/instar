/**
 * ConversationLogTailer — real-time tail of a provider's session log.
 *
 * Watches the provider's session log file (or equivalent) and emits new
 * events as they're appended. Used for stall detection, crash detection,
 * activity tracking — instar's stall-detector.ts, crash-detector.ts, and
 * ActivityPartitioner all use this pattern today.
 *
 * Distinct from `ConversationLogReader` (post-hoc, finite read) and from
 * `LiveOutputStream` (terminal-level output capture). This primitive is
 * for following a session's structured event log as it grows.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude: tail `~/.claude/projects/<path>/<uuid>.jsonl` via polling
 *     (no inotify hook today)
 *   - Codex: tail `~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-*.jsonl` via polling
 *
 * Most providers don't offer fsnotify-style change events for their log
 * files, so adapters typically poll. The abstraction hides the polling
 * interval as an implementation detail.
