/**
 * ProcessLifecycle — observe the OS-level process state of a session.
 *
 * Sessions usually run as subprocess (claude CLI, codex CLI) — this
 * primitive reports whether the underlying process is alive, what its PID
 * is, and signals when it exits. Used by orphan-process reapers,
 * memory-pressure monitors, and crash detection.
 *
 * Maps to:
 *   - Claude tmux: pid from tmux pane info; alive via `kill -0 <pid>`
 *   - Codex CLI: same pattern when CLI is spawned as subprocess
 *   - Codex app-server: server's `/readyz` / `/healthz` HTTP probes
 *
 * Distinct from session-level lifecycle events (those describe the agent's
 * progress); this primitive is about the host process. A session can be
 * "active" but its process can have crashed — both states matter for
 * different consumers.
