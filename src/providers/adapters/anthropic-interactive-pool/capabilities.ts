/**
 * Capability declaration for the anthropic-interactive-pool adapter.
 *
 * Declares ONLY the capabilities the pool actually implements — no
 * stub-only entries. The previous version claimed the full universal
 * capability surface even for primitives that were wired to throwing
 * stubs; the Phase 3c parity harness now catches that as a "declared
 * but mixed real/stub" lie and fails the suite. The honest fix is to
 * stop claiming what we don't implement, which is what this file does.
 *
 * Primary role: warm REPL pool driven by prompt injection. Owns
 * WarmSessionInbox and a pool-routed OneShotCompletion. Owns the
 * session-control primitives the pool needs to manage its REPLs
 * (HardKill / Interrupt / InputInjection / etc.). Owns
 * LiveOutputStream / ProcessLifecycle / SessionId for pool-session
 * observability.
 *
 * Anything NOT in this list — long-running autonomous sessions
 * (AgenticSessionHeadless), capability-layer primitives, asymmetric
 * observability that reads provider state files (ConversationLogReader,
 * HookEventReceiver, UsageMeterProvider, etc.), integration primitives
 * — routes to anthropic-headless via the registry. The pool adapter
 * does not claim them, so it isn't a candidate.
