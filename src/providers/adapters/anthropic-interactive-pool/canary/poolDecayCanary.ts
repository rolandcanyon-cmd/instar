/**
 * Pool decay handler canary.
 *
 * Per Rule 3.2 of the path constraints: every state-detection / failure-
 * handling code path against an evolving system must have a canary that
 * verifies the handler still works correctly. This canary covers the
 * replacement-spawn retry path in `pool.ts` (Bug B fix): when a session
 * retirement triggers a replacement spawn and the spawn fails, the pool
 * should emit `pool:degraded`, schedule retries with exponential backoff,
 * and emit `pool:healed` or `pool:degraded_persistent` based on outcome.
 *
 * RULE 3.1 RATIONALE
 *   Criticality: high (silent decay → unbounded allocate timeouts)
 *   Frequency:   event-driven; canary runs weekly to verify the mechanism still functions
 *   Stability:   very stable (JS-level errors, not upstream-UI)
 *   Fallback:    routing policy can route to anthropic-headless when pool is degraded
 *   Verdict:     deterministic + light canary (weekly cadence)
 *
 * Drift risk is low (we control the JS code that defines the contract),
 * but the canary serves a different purpose here: it verifies the
 * handler's wiring stays intact through refactors. If a future change
 * accidentally swallows spawn errors again, this canary fails loudly.
 *
 * Cadence: weekly per spec. Doesn't run at every startup; runs at
 * startup-of-the-week or first startup after the canary's persisted
 * last-run timestamp has aged out.
