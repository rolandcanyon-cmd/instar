/**
 * Empty-prompt detector canary.
 *
 * Per Rule 3 of the path constraints (see specs/provider-portability/
 * 05-state-detection-robustness.md): every state-detection code path that
 * parses output from an evolving upstream system ships with a canary
 * that verifies the detector still reads the upstream correctly, and
 * self-heals when it doesn't.
 *
 * This canary runs at pool spawn (per session) and on a recurring
 * schedule. It does NOT use the completion detector being tested —
 * instead it uses a fixed-time wait so it can independently observe
 * upstream drift. The flow:
 *
 *   1. Capture the pane buffer BEFORE sending (baseline).
 *   2. Send a known short prompt: "reply with only the digit 7".
 *   3. Wait a fixed window (default 20s — generous for a 1-token reply).
 *   4. Capture the pane AFTER.
 *   5. Verify the new content (after \ before) contains "7" — proves the
 *      response itself completed. If not: hard failure.
 *   6. Find the empty prompt line in the after-buffer — that's the
 *      structural signature the detector should look for.
 *   7. If the current signature would have detected completion on this
 *      pane: signature is still valid, no action.
 *   8. If not: re-derive the signature from the structurally-located
 *      empty prompt line, set it as the new active signature. This is
 *      the self-heal path.
 *
 * On hard failure (step 5: the model itself didn't respond as expected,
 * suggesting Claude Code is in a fundamentally different state than we
 * understand), the canary reports a DegradationReporter event. The
 * pool refuses to bring the session up. Per Rule 3.2 this surfaces to
 * Echo-only Telegram by default.
