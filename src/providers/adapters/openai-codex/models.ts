import type { ModelTier } from '../../types.js';

/**
 * Default tier-to-name map. Callers can override per-call via
 * OneShotCompletionOptions.model or AgenticSessionHeadlessOptions.model
 * (which accepts either a tier name or a raw model name).
 *
 * Model availability on the ChatGPT subscription auth path differs from
 * OPENAI_API_KEY auth. Per OpenAI Community thread 1378986 (referenced
 * 2026-05-15), several `-codex` suffixed model names were retired from
 * ChatGPT accounts on 2026-04-14 and are API-only now.
 *
 * RE-PROBED 2026-05-23 against Justin's ChatGPT subscription via
 * codex-cli 0.133.0 (live, during the codex test harness):
 *
 *   ✅ working on ChatGPT account:  gpt-5.2, gpt-5.3-codex, gpt-5.4, gpt-5.5 (NEW)
 *   ❌ rejected on ChatGPT account: gpt-5.5-codex, gpt-5.4-codex
 *                                   ("not supported when using Codex with a
 *                                   ChatGPT account"), and the older
 *                                   gpt-5, gpt-5-codex, gpt-5.2-codex, gpt-5.3.
 *   Pattern holds: plain gpt-5.x models work; `-codex` suffix is API-only
 *   EXCEPT the grandfathered gpt-5.3-codex.
 *
 * TOKEN-BURN observation (same trivial "reply OK" prompt, 2026-05-23):
 *   gpt-5.2 = 103 tokens · gpt-5.3-codex = 5,574 · gpt-5.5 = 7,399.
 *   The reasoning models (5.3-codex, 5.5) burn ~50-70x more than gpt-5.2
 *   even on a trivial prompt (reasoning overhead). This is why the `fast`
 *   tier — used by cheap internal calls (gates, tone-gate, classification)
 *   — MUST stay on gpt-5.2: routing those through a reasoning model would
 *   torch quota. The reasoning burn is only worth it for real session work.
 *
 * Default tier choices below favor the subscription path:
 *   - fast:     gpt-5.2 (cheapest working; NO reasoning overhead — keep for
 *                all cheap internal LLM calls)
 *   - balanced: gpt-5.3-codex (coding-specialist tier — the session default)
 *   - capable:  gpt-5.4 (most powerful older tier; high burn, use sparingly)
 *
 * gpt-5.5 is now Codex CLI's OWN default (codey's ~/.codex/config.toml) and
 * is confirmed working on the subscription. Whether to promote the session
 * default from gpt-5.3-codex (coding-specialist) to gpt-5.5 (newest
 * generalist) is a product decision pending a real coding-quality + burn
 * benchmark — NOT changed here to avoid a silent default shift. gpt-5.5 is
 * available now via a raw per-call model name.
 *
 * Callers on the API-key path can override these per-call to access the
 * full model surface (gpt-5-codex, etc.) by passing a raw model name
 * instead of a tier.
 *
 * Drift risk: model availability changes regularly. This map is a
 * Rule-3 surface and the codex event-normalizer canary catches the
 * resulting upstream errors (auth-classified error events), but the
 * authoritative-name check belongs in a dedicated canary — Phase 5
 * follow-up.
