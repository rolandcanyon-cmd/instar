/**
 * Stub-primitive factory for the openai-codex adapter.
 *
 * Used by the parity-test harness when it needs to verify that a
 * capability flag is honestly declared. The parity check fails if the
 * adapter returns a `stub` primitive for a capability the adapter has
 * declared in capabilities.ts — that would be lying about capability.
 *
 * RULE 3.1 RATIONALE
 *   Criticality: high (capability-declaration honesty)
 *   Frequency:   parity-test runs only (test-time)
 *   Stability:   very stable (Symbol.for identity)
 *   Fallback:    none required
 *   Verdict:     deterministic; reused canary at
 *                src/providers/canary/capabilityHonestyCanary.ts already
 *                covers both Anthropic factories — extended to cover this
 *                adapter in this batch.
