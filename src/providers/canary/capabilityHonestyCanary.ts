/**
 * Capability-honesty marker canary.
 *
 * Per Rule 3.2 of the path constraints: every state-detection /
 * contract-preserving code path needs a paired canary that verifies
 * the mechanism still works correctly. This canary covers the
 * STUB_MARKER symbol (`src/providers/markers.ts`, Bug D fix area):
 * when an adapter's `createStubPrimitive` factory returns a proxy,
 * the marker must be readable via `isStubPrimitive` without tripping
 * the proxy's throwing-method branch.
 *
 * RULE 3.1 RATIONALE
 *   Criticality: high (capability-declaration honesty — missed marker = lying adapter)
 *   Frequency:   parity test runs (transitively via the parity check)
 *   Stability:   very stable (internal symbol)
 *   Fallback:    none required — symbol identity is deterministic
 *   Verdict:     deterministic + startup canary (startup-only cadence)
 *
 * Drift risk: low for the marker itself (Symbol.for is stable). Real
 * risk is "a future stub factory refactor forgets to attach the
 * marker." This canary catches that regression at startup loudly.
