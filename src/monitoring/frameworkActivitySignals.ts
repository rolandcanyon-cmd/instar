/**
 * frameworkActivitySignals — per-framework patterns for spotting tool
 * calls, spinners, shell exits, and "press X to interrupt" hints in
 * tmux output.
 *
 * Provider-portability v1.0.0: before this module, StallTriageNurse
 * hardcoded Claude-Code's tool names and Braille spinner characters
 * directly in its heuristicDiagnose path. That made the nurse blind to
 * Codex sessions — their activity signature is different.
 *
 * Each signal carries the regexes the nurse needs to answer three
 * yes/no questions about a captured tmux pane:
 *   1. Is the framework actively doing something? (toolCallOrSpinner)
 *   2. Did the framework wrapper exit, leaving a bare shell? (shellExited)
 *   3. Is the framework prompting the user to interrupt a long op?
 *      (escapeToInterrupt)
 *
 * Adding a new framework is a one-line union extension plus a new entry
 * in `ACTIVITY_SIGNALS`. The exhaustiveness check in `getActivitySignal`
 * forces a compile error if a case is missed.
