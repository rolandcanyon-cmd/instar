/**
 * Compaction-resume payload builder.
 *
 * When a session's context window fills and Claude Code compresses the
 * conversation, the agent loses its working memory. The compaction-recovery
 * helpers in server.ts then inject a prompt telling the agent to re-orient
 * and continue — but the old prompt was a single sentence telling the agent
 * to "read the recent messages in this topic." In practice the agent
 * reconstructed a generic status summary instead of answering the actual
 * intent of the user's last message, because the context it needed was
 * never placed in front of it.
 *
 * This module builds a richer payload that matches the context the
 * session-spawn path already ships (summary + recent messages + a lookup
 * hint for searching deeper history). Ported into the compaction-resume
 * path, the agent has the same shape of context it had at first spawn —
 * no reason to fabricate a plausible-sounding status.
 *
 * Also handles the file-threshold pattern: payloads that exceed the tmux
 * bracketed-paste comfort zone get written to a temp file and replaced
 * with a "read this file" reference in the injection.
