 * The server's `process.on('uncaughtException')` handler crashes by default —
 * the safe thing for a truly-unknown exception. But a small set of exceptions
 * are ISOLATED and recoverable: the failing operation has already unwound, the
 * rest of the agent (databases, HTTP, the other messaging platforms) is intact,
 * and the owning subsystem self-heals. For those, crashing the whole agent —
 * which closes its SQLite databases and drops in-flight work — is strictly worse

 *
 * Extracted from server.ts so the decision boundary is unit-testable on both

 * is isolated + recoverable; keep the list tight.

 * is exactly one allowlist, one default-crash posture, one dedup'd log path.
 *
 * Behavior:
 * - A non-fatal match (`isNonFatalUncaught`) → `console.warn` (with the first-seen
 *   stack attached once per distinct origin) and returns `'recovered'`. The server
 *   stays up.
 * - Anything else → `console.error`, run `opts.onFatalCleanup()` (best-effort —
 *   wrapped so a cleanup failure can't mask the original error), then exit(1) and
 *   return `'fatal'`. This is the fail-toward-crash default: an unknown error
 *   crashes, and net #2 respawns a clean process in ~10s.
 *
 * Cleanup and exit are INJECTED callbacks (server.ts passes `closeAllSqlite` and
 * the real `process.exit`) so this module stays pure decision-logic — it does NOT
 * import the SQLite registry, and the unit test injects fakes to assert the fatal
 * path triggers cleanup + exit under BOTH labels without actually exiting.
 *
 * The `exit` callback is typed `(code) => never`, but the function still has a
 * trailing `return 'fatal'`: with the real `process.exit` that line is
 * unreachable; with an injected test fake that returns, the assertion can observe
 * the verdict. This is the standard injectable-exit test pattern.
