/**
 * CodexCliIntelligenceProvider — IntelligenceProvider using the OpenAI Codex CLI.
 *
 * Sibling of ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider. Routes judgment calls through
 * `codex exec` for non-Claude installs. Same fast/balanced/capable tier
 * mapping the Codex adapter uses for first-class calls; same timeout
 * semantics; same fail-loudly behavior so callers can fall back.
 *
 * Provider-portability v1.0.0: this is the second IntelligenceProvider
 * implementation. Reviewers, sentinels, canaries, and JobReflector now
 * have a non-Claude path. The composition root picks the right
 * implementation based on the agent's configured framework.

 * Lazily create and return an EMPTY scratch directory used as the `--cd`
 * for every judgment call.
 *
 * Running `codex exec` in the agent's project directory loads the full
 * ~26 KB `AGENTS.md` identity AND fires the project's `.codex/hooks.json`
 * hooks (session_start / user_prompt_submit / stop) on every call — turning
 * a one-word classification into a full agent boot. An empty, hook-free
 * scratch dir gives these calls the clean-notepad guarantee that
 * `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` gets via `--setting-sources user`:
 * no project doc, and no project hooks.
 *
 * SECURITY (why mkdtemp, not a fixed name): Codex discovers hooks by walking
 * UP from the cwd and fires any `.codex/hooks.json` it finds — and
 * `project_doc_max_bytes=0` does NOT cover hooks. On Linux `os.tmpdir()` is
 * the world-writable `/tmp`, so a fixed, guessable dir name could be
 * pre-created (or symlinked) by another local user with a planted
 * `.codex/hooks.json`, re-introducing hook execution under our identity.
 * `mkdtempSync` defeats this: it appends an unguessable random suffix, creates
 * the dir with mode 0700 owned by this process, and refuses to follow a
 * pre-existing path — so nothing can be planted in the cwd these calls run in.
 *
 * The dir is re-verified each call: a tmp-reaper may delete it during a
 * long-lived process, so we recreate it if it has gone missing.
 *
 * Bug (2026-05-26): ~1,550 such judgment spawns/day were re-injecting the
 * identity + firing session_start, causing notification spam and spawn-storm
 * delivery failures. Spec: CODEX-INTELLIGENCE-PROVIDER-CLEAN-CALL-SPEC.md.
