## What Changed

### Temporal Coherence Checker

New module that detects when draft content reflects outdated thinking — perspectives the agent has since evolved past. Born from a real incident: a draft written weeks earlier used "death" framing for a concept the agent had since reframed as "choice," creating public incoherence.

**`TemporalCoherenceChecker`** (`src/core/TemporalCoherenceChecker.ts`):
- Compares draft content against agent identity documents (AGENT.md, reflections), published content timeline (PlatformActivityRegistry), and canonical state quick facts (CanonicalState)
- Uses `IntelligenceProvider` for LLM-based evaluation with configurable severity capping
- Returns structured results: `COHERENT`, `EVOLVED`, or `OUTDATED` assessment with specific issues
- Gracefully degrades to "no issues" when no IntelligenceProvider is configured

**Integration points:**
- Standalone: `checker.check(draftContent)` → `TemporalCoherenceResult`
- With PlatformActivityRegistry: Auto-loads published content timeline for comparison
- With CanonicalState: Auto-loads agent's current positions on key topics
- With CoherenceGate: Can be combined for layered pre-publish safety

**Configuration:**
- `stateDocuments`: Custom paths to identity documents (default: AGENT.md, .instar/reflections.md)
- `maxSeverity`: Cap severity at WARN to prevent temporal checks from blocking (recommended)
- `maxCharsPerDocument`: Control prompt budget (default: 2000)
- `timelineWindowHours`: How far back to look in published content (default: 720 = 30 days)

### Convergence Check — 7th Criterion

The heuristic convergence check (`convergence-check.sh`) now includes a 7th criterion: **temporal_staleness**. Catches language patterns suggesting stale drafts ("I used to think", "back when I first", "my early understanding", "before I learned", etc.). Zero-cost pre-filter — no LLM calls.

Updated both the template file and the PostUpdateMigrator inline fallback.

## What to Tell Your User

- **"Your agent won't accidentally post outdated thinking"**: If your agent's understanding has evolved since a draft was written, the temporal coherence checker catches the mismatch before publishing. Think of it as a "is this still what I think?" check.

- **"The convergence check now catches 7 anti-patterns"**: The pre-messaging quality gate now includes temporal staleness detection alongside capability claims, commitment overreach, settling, experiential fabrication, sycophancy, and URL provenance.

## Summary of New Capabilities

| Capability | How to Use |
|-----------|-----------|
| Temporal coherence check (LLM) | `new TemporalCoherenceChecker(config)` then `checker.check(draft)` |
| Temporal staleness heuristic | Automatic — included in convergence-check.sh criterion #7 |
| Severity capping | Set `maxSeverity: 'WARN'` in config to prevent temporal blocking |
| Published content timeline | Pass `activityRegistry` to auto-load comparison timeline |
| Canonical state integration | Pass `canonicalState` to include quick facts in evaluation |
