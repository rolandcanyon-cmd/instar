## What Changed

Tier 1.A mode (a) landed: third framework `claude-code-agent-sdk` for Telegram topics. Uses the same Claude Code binary and interactive flags as `claude-code`, but the launch builder forcibly clears `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and sets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` so the session bills against the Agent SDK $200/mo Max 20x credit bucket (per the June 2026 Anthropic billing notice) instead of the operator's subscription pool. Credential source priority: dedicated `credentials.anthropic-agent-sdk` slot → legacy `anthropicApiKey` (if not OAuth-shape) → process-env fallback with warning. `INSTAR_FRAMEWORK=agent-sdk` and aliases normalize to the new value. 4 new builder tests plus enumeration updates across activity + process signal suites. Confirmed test count at 147 across all touched-area suites.

Tier 1.A (spawnInteractiveSession framework dispatch + per-topic override) landed: the foundational Telegram-driven session spawn path no longer hardcodes Claude's CLI flags. New `src/core/frameworkSessionLaunch.ts` carries per-framework builders that return `{ argv, envOverrides }`; SessionManager dispatches to the right builder based on a new optional `framework` parameter. New `InstarConfig.topicFrameworks` map (`{ "9984": "claude-code", "9985": "codex-cli" }`) lets operators flip a single topic to a different framework without changing the agent's overall framework. `spawnSessionForTopic` and `respawnSessionForTopic` consult the per-topic map via a `resolveTopicFramework(topicId)` helper. `SessionManagerConfig.frameworkBinaryPaths` populated from detection at load time so the dispatcher picks the right binary. Existing Claude callers behave identically. The Agent SDK spawn mode is deferred — needs a different shape than tmux'd CLIs. 12 new launch-builder tests; 181 touched-area tests still pass.

Tier 2.B+ (SessionWatchdog framework-aware PID resolution) landed: the watchdog's `getClaudePid` resolved the in-pane CLI process by matching `^claude$` / `/claude$` directly, so for Codex installs it returned null and the watchdog silently no-opped on every Codex session. New `getFrameworkPid` walks `listProcessSignals()` (reusing Tier 2.C's framework process signals) and matches both bare-name (`claude`, `codex`) and path-tail forms, then falls back to a multi-needle egrep on the pane's child processes. The 65 existing watchdog tests all pass.

Tier 2.E (subsystem framework-aware intelligence) landed: server-boot smoke test of `INSTAR_FRAMEWORK=codex-cli` revealed that three subsystems were still constructing their own `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` rather than reusing the framework-aware `sharedIntelligence` singleton: RelationshipManager (identity resolution), TopicSummarizer (session-completion summaries), and JobReflector (via `instar reflect`). All three now consult `sharedIntelligence` first and fall back to a Claude provider only when sharedIntelligence couldn't be built. Boot log now reports `Relationships loaded: 0 tracked (LLM-supervised (Codex CLI))` instead of always claiming Claude. No interface changes, no new tests (call-site re-pointer to an already-tested singleton).

Tier 4.C release blocker (Codex non-git directory fix): the `CodexCliIntelligenceProvider` was silently failing for every Codex-based agent whose state directory wasn't a git checkout. Codex CLI refused to run with `--cd <non-git-dir>` and the resulting error was masked downstream as `taskPattern: "unclassified"` (the classifier's catch-all). Added `--skip-git-repo-check` to the `codex exec` invocation; these reviewer/sentinel/canary calls don't depend on the cwd being a trusted git repo. Surfaced and verified via end-to-end smoke test (`INSTAR_FRAMEWORK=codex-cli node dist/cli.js route "refactor python helper"`) that previously produced `auto-defaulted-unclassified` in 0.8s; now produces `code-refactor-python` / `auto-defaulted-no-topic` in ~4s. 5 new regression tests use a fake codex script to assert the exact spawn-arg shape.

## Evidence

**Codex non-git directory fix** — reproduced and verified.

Before (broken):
```
$ INSTAR_FRAMEWORK=codex-cli node dist/cli.js route "refactor this old python helper to use type hints" --dir /tmp/codex-smoke-2 --json
{
  "framework": "claude-code",
  "model": "opus-4.7",
  "taskPattern": "unclassified",
  "source": "auto-defaulted-unclassified",
  ...
}
# Internal Codex error visible only on direct provider call:
#   Codex CLI error: Command failed: /Users/.../bin/codex exec --model gpt-5.2 --sandbox read-only --cd /tmp/codex-smoke-2/.instar ...
#   Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified.
```

After:
```
$ INSTAR_FRAMEWORK=codex-cli node dist/cli.js route "refactor this old python helper to use type hints" --dir /tmp/codex-smoke-2 --json
{
  "framework": "claude-code",
  "model": "opus-4.7",
  "taskPattern": "code-refactor-python",
  "source": "auto-defaulted-no-topic",
  ...
}
```

Tier 2.C (OrphanProcessReaper framework awareness) landed: the orphan-process sentinel no longer hardcodes Claude's binary patterns or its `grep -i '[c]laude'` prefilter. New `src/monitoring/frameworkProcessSignals.ts` exposes per-framework `psGrepNeedle`, `binaryPattern`, `nodePattern`, exclusion list, and display name; the reaper builds a single `ps … | egrep …` over every framework's needle and tags each process with the matched framework via `matchProcessSignal`. `FrameworkProcess` is the new canonical type (Claude/Codex/etc.); `ClaudeProcess` lives on as a deprecated alias for one release cycle. External-process Telegram alerts now group counts by framework display name. Orphan Codex processes are now detected and cleaned identically to orphan Claude processes. Also rewrote one orphaned `StallTriageNurse` test that asserted on the Rule-2-removed direct-API fallback; the replacement asserts the actual post-Rule-2 heuristic-fallback contract. 24 new signal tests + 200 existing tests pass.

Tier 2.B (StallTriageNurse framework awareness) landed: the stall-detection sentinel's heuristic pre-filter no longer hardcodes Claude Code's tool-call regex and spinner glyphs. New `src/monitoring/frameworkActivitySignals.ts` exposes per-framework activity signatures (`toolCallOrSpinner`, `escapeToInterrupt`, `runningIndicator`, plus a prompt-signatures line injected into the LLM system prompt). The nurse reads `config.framework` from `StallTriageConfig` (defaulting to claude-code for backwards-compat), and `server.ts` threads the resolved `INSTAR_FRAMEWORK` value into the construction site. Previously the shell-prompt restart heuristic would false-fire on a healthy Codex pane (no Claude tokens → "framework wrapper has exited"); now it correctly recognizes Codex tool tokens. 22 new tests (16 signal-module + 6 framework-aware heuristics).

CoherenceReviewer subclasses and CoherenceGate dropped the unused `apiKey` constructor parameter — dead since the Rule 2 path-constraint lockdown removed the direct-Anthropic-API fallback. Reviewer LLM calls already route exclusively through the IntelligenceProvider; the key was being stored but never read.

CoherenceGate now requires an IntelligenceProvider. When none is wired, the response review pipeline is disabled with a warning instead of attempting a raw API fallback.

Internal-only API change: external code that constructs CoherenceGate directly must drop `apiKey` from the options bag and supply `intelligence`.

The anthropic-interactive-pool adapter now accepts an optional `llmFallback` in its config. The empty-prompt canary (Rule 3 detector for the pool's idle signal) had a tested LLM-fallback contract but no application-layer wiring — that's now plumbed end-to-end. Adapter clients can opt in by passing `buildCanaryLlmFallback(intelligence)`; omitting it preserves deterministic-only behavior.

Phase 5c shipped: `CostAwareRoutingPolicy` and `CostStateTracker` in `src/providers/costAwareRouting.ts`. The policy implements the path-constraints "Routing default" (drain SDK credit pot while above the 10% safety margin, switch to subscription floor when at or below). The tracker emits `CostStateSnapshot` objects with a `isMaterialShift` helper Phase 5b consumes to decide when to re-ask the user. Pure additive infrastructure — not yet wired into the runtime; that wiring lands with Phase 5b implementation. 23 unit tests cover every row of the decision matrix and every material-shift category.

Phase 5b.1 shipped: `PreferenceStore` (sqlite-backed cache of framework+model picks keyed by user × task pattern) and `TriggerGate` (pure-function decision logic implementing Phase 5b's three-trigger rule with priority ordering). Both live under `src/providers/uxConfirm/`. The remaining Phase 5b components — TaskClassifier, TelegramConfirmer, OverrideDetector, and the FrameworkModelRouter composition root — land in subsequent slices.

Phase 5b.2 shipped: `TaskClassifier` and `OverrideDetector` — both fast-tier IntelligenceProvider classifiers under `src/providers/uxConfirm/`. The classifier maps a task prompt to a stable kebab-case slug (the cache key for preferences). The detector spots routing overrides in free-text messages ("use Gemini for this one") via LLM, not regex, per the "intelligence over string matching" rule. Both fail-safe on errors — unclassified slug or no-override outcome — so the UX never silently auto-uses a wrong pick. 33 new unit tests pass (13 classifier + 20 detector, including the 8 phrasing variants the spec required).

Phase 5b.3 shipped: `TelegramConfirmer` — the blocking suggest-and-confirm round-trip. Sends the structured prompt via a thin `ConfirmationTransport` interface (testable without real Telegram), blocks on next reply with timeout, parses replies through four deterministic shorthand paths (`ok|c|👍|no|once|/route reset`) before falling through to the LLM-backed `OverrideDetector` for free-text. Returns a discriminated `ConfirmationResult` (`confirmed | overridden | reset | default-no-reply`). 30 new tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage now 86 tests.

Phase 5b.4 shipped: `FrameworkModelRouter` — the composition root that ties every Phase 5b component into the full flow. Returns a structured `RouteResult` with eight distinct `source` values covering every outcome (cached-silent, confirmed, confirmed-one-shot, overridden-this-task, overridden-this-pattern, reset-defaulted, auto-defaulted-no-topic, auto-defaulted-no-reply, auto-defaulted-unclassified). Cache writes are scoped strictly to user-confirmed paths. The `CatalogProvider` interface abstracts over Phase 5a artifacts so the router doesn't read markdown directly. 13 router tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage 99 tests.

Phase 5b.5.c shipped: `instar route <task...>` CLI subcommand — a thin composition root that wires every Phase 5b component (TaskClassifier, OverrideDetector, PreferenceStore, StaticCatalogProvider, CostStateTracker, TelegramConfirmer, FrameworkModelRouter) and runs a single classification. Forces `telegramTopicId: null` so the CLI path is deterministic (no-topic → catalog default). Lets Justin exercise the end-to-end Phase 5b flow against his real IntelligenceProvider (Claude or Codex per `INSTAR_FRAMEWORK`) without standing up the full HTTP/Telegram wiring. AgentServer integration deferred — that wiring touches the massive injected-dependencies constructor and is tracked separately.

Phase 5b.5.b shipped: `TelegramConfirmationTransport` — bridges the push-based `MessagingAdapter.onMessage` contract to the pull-based `ConfirmationTransport.awaitReply` contract Phase 5b.3 requires. Per-topic waiter queue with timeout; supersession (new awaitReply on same topic resolves prior with null); drop-on-no-waiter for stale replies; shutdown resolves all pending. Composable via `MinimalMessagingAdapter` + caller-supplied `topicFromInbound` / `outboundForTopic` — same class drives Slack/iMessage/etc. when those land. 9 new tests against a fake adapter; cumulative uxConfirm coverage 124 tests.

Phase 5b.5.a shipped: `StaticCatalogProvider` — hand-curated CatalogProvider implementation. 20 task-pattern defaults derived from the Phase 5a catalogs (code-generation/refactor/debug → Opus 4.7; web-research → Sonnet 4.6; summarize/draft/shell → Haiku 4.5; etc.) plus per-(framework, model) confidence baselines and a `CATALOG_VERSION` string that drives Phase 5b's re-ask trigger. Hand-curated rather than markdown-parsed: deliberate updates when the catalog moves, not silent drift from regex breakage. 16 new tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage 115 tests.

Tier 0 release blocker fixed: stripped a hardcoded developer-specific path (`/Users/justin/.asdf/installs/nodejs/22.18.0/bin/codex`) from the Codex adapter default config. Replaced with a new framework-agnostic `detectFrameworkBinary(name)` helper that searches install locations, npm-global, nvm-managed, and PATH for any of eight known framework binaries (claude, codex, gemini, aider, goose, cursor-cli, opencode, plandex). Includes a source-level regression test that fails if any future commit re-introduces the asdf hardcode.

Tier 1.B (multi-provider credentials) landed: new `ProviderCredentialKind` + `ProviderCredential` types, new `SessionManagerConfig.credentials: { [providerId]: ... }` field with legacy `anthropicApiKey` / `anthropicBaseUrl` automatically migrated at load time. New helpers `getProviderCredential(config, providerId)` and `buildProviderEnvFlags(providerId, cred)` give code paths a clean way to ask "do I have a credential for X" and "what env vars do I inject when spawning a subprocess for provider X." SessionManager spawn paths are unchanged in this slice — they still read the legacy field; migration to the helper is a follow-up. 14 tests cover migration, kind detection, baseUrl propagation, lookup fallback, and env-flag building for anthropic/openai/google + unknown-provider safe-no-op.

Tier 1.C (Codex intelligence provider) landed: new `CodexCliIntelligenceProvider` sibling of `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider`. Routes evaluate() calls through `codex exec` with tier→model mapping reused from the Codex adapter. Plus a `buildIntelligenceProvider({ framework })` factory that picks the right implementation at startup, and a `frameworkFromEnv()` parser for the new `INSTAR_FRAMEWORK` env var (accepts `claude-code` / `claude` / `codex-cli` / `codex` case-insensitive). Until now `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` was the ONLY implementation, so every reviewer/sentinel/canary ran `claude -p` exclusively — "supports Codex" was a promise we couldn't keep. 10 tests cover framework selection, binary detection fallback, env-var parsing.

Tier 1.D (identity-file rendering) landed: AGENT.md is now the canonical source of truth for an agent's identity. New `IdentityRenderer` module reads `.instar/AGENT.md` and writes framework-specific shadow files (CLAUDE.md for Claude Code, AGENTS.md for Codex, GEMINI.md for Gemini) with an auto-generation banner warning against hand-editing. ProjectMapper lookup priority flipped to AGENT.md first, CLAUDE.md fallback (existing installs keep working). Migration path: `bootstrapAgentMdFromShadow` reads legacy CLAUDE.md content, strips banner, writes canonical AGENT.md. 16 tests cover render, banner content, framework subset, source fallback, throw-on-missing, framework detection, and migration bootstrap.

Tier 2.A (framework-aware boot prerequisite) landed: `Config.load()` no longer throws "Claude CLI not found" unconditionally. New pure helpers `resolveConfiguredFramework()` (picks active framework from config / INSTAR_FRAMEWORK env / default claude-code) and `checkFrameworkPrerequisite()` (validates the configured framework's binary is installed) decouple boot logic from Claude. Codex-cli installs now boot cleanly with only the codex binary present. Error messages are framework-specific with the right install command. New `sessions.framework` config field + `INSTAR_FRAMEWORK` env var (accepts claude-code/claude/codex-cli/codex). 11 tests cover every framework × binary-presence combination.
