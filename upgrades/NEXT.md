# Upgrade Guide — vNEXT

<!-- bump: patch -->

## What Changed

Job topics that were eagerly created by versions before v0.12.7 (when `on-alert` became the default notification mode) are now cleaned up on startup. When `ensureJobTopics` runs, it detects stale topic mappings for jobs in `on-alert` or `never` mode, closes the Telegram forum topics, and removes the mappings from state. This eliminates the visual noise of empty job topics cluttering the Telegram group.

The cleanup is idempotent — topics that are already closed or deleted are handled gracefully.

## What to Tell Your User

- **Quieter Telegram**: "Job topics that were created before the quiet-by-default update will be automatically cleaned up. Your Telegram group should be much less cluttered now — only jobs that actually need your attention will have topics."

## Summary of New Capabilities
