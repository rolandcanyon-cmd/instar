## What Changed

CoherenceReviewer subclasses and CoherenceGate dropped the unused `apiKey` constructor parameter — dead since the Rule 2 path-constraint lockdown removed the direct-Anthropic-API fallback. Reviewer LLM calls already route exclusively through the IntelligenceProvider; the key was being stored but never read.

CoherenceGate now requires an IntelligenceProvider. When none is wired, the response review pipeline is disabled with a warning instead of attempting a raw API fallback.

Internal-only API change: external code that constructs CoherenceGate directly must drop `apiKey` from the options bag and supply `intelligence`.

The anthropic-interactive-pool adapter now accepts an optional `llmFallback` in its config. The empty-prompt canary (Rule 3 detector for the pool's idle signal) had a tested LLM-fallback contract but no application-layer wiring — that's now plumbed end-to-end. Adapter clients can opt in by passing `buildCanaryLlmFallback(intelligence)`; omitting it preserves deterministic-only behavior.

Phase 5c shipped: `CostAwareRoutingPolicy` and `CostStateTracker` in `src/providers/costAwareRouting.ts`. The policy implements the path-constraints "Routing default" (drain SDK credit pot while above the 10% safety margin, switch to subscription floor when at or below). The tracker emits `CostStateSnapshot` objects with a `isMaterialShift` helper Phase 5b consumes to decide when to re-ask the user. Pure additive infrastructure — not yet wired into the runtime; that wiring lands with Phase 5b implementation. 23 unit tests cover every row of the decision matrix and every material-shift category.

Phase 5b.1 shipped: `PreferenceStore` (sqlite-backed cache of framework+model picks keyed by user × task pattern) and `TriggerGate` (pure-function decision logic implementing Phase 5b's three-trigger rule with priority ordering). Both live under `src/providers/uxConfirm/`. The remaining Phase 5b components — TaskClassifier, TelegramConfirmer, OverrideDetector, and the FrameworkModelRouter composition root — land in subsequent slices.

Phase 5b.2 shipped: `TaskClassifier` and `OverrideDetector` — both fast-tier IntelligenceProvider classifiers under `src/providers/uxConfirm/`. The classifier maps a task prompt to a stable kebab-case slug (the cache key for preferences). The detector spots routing overrides in free-text messages ("use Gemini for this one") via LLM, not regex, per the "intelligence over string matching" rule. Both fail-safe on errors — unclassified slug or no-override outcome — so the UX never silently auto-uses a wrong pick. 33 new unit tests pass (13 classifier + 20 detector, including the 8 phrasing variants the spec required).

Phase 5b.3 shipped: `TelegramConfirmer` — the blocking suggest-and-confirm round-trip. Sends the structured prompt via a thin `ConfirmationTransport` interface (testable without real Telegram), blocks on next reply with timeout, parses replies through four deterministic shorthand paths (`ok|c|👍|no|once|/route reset`) before falling through to the LLM-backed `OverrideDetector` for free-text. Returns a discriminated `ConfirmationResult` (`confirmed | overridden | reset | default-no-reply`). 30 new tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage now 86 tests.

Phase 5b.4 shipped: `FrameworkModelRouter` — the composition root that ties every Phase 5b component into the full flow. Returns a structured `RouteResult` with eight distinct `source` values covering every outcome (cached-silent, confirmed, confirmed-one-shot, overridden-this-task, overridden-this-pattern, reset-defaulted, auto-defaulted-no-topic, auto-defaulted-no-reply, auto-defaulted-unclassified). Cache writes are scoped strictly to user-confirmed paths. The `CatalogProvider` interface abstracts over Phase 5a artifacts so the router doesn't read markdown directly. 13 router tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage 99 tests.

Phase 5b.5.a shipped: `StaticCatalogProvider` — hand-curated CatalogProvider implementation. 20 task-pattern defaults derived from the Phase 5a catalogs (code-generation/refactor/debug → Opus 4.7; web-research → Sonnet 4.6; summarize/draft/shell → Haiku 4.5; etc.) plus per-(framework, model) confidence baselines and a `CATALOG_VERSION` string that drives Phase 5b's re-ask trigger. Hand-curated rather than markdown-parsed: deliberate updates when the catalog moves, not silent drift from regex breakage. 16 new tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage 115 tests.

Tier 0 release blocker fixed: stripped a hardcoded developer-specific path (`/Users/justin/.asdf/installs/nodejs/22.18.0/bin/codex`) from the Codex adapter default config. Replaced with a new framework-agnostic `detectFrameworkBinary(name)` helper that searches install locations, npm-global, nvm-managed, and PATH for any of eight known framework binaries (claude, codex, gemini, aider, goose, cursor-cli, opencode, plandex). Includes a source-level regression test that fails if any future commit re-introduces the asdf hardcode.

Tier 1.B (multi-provider credentials) landed: new `ProviderCredentialKind` + `ProviderCredential` types, new `SessionManagerConfig.credentials: { [providerId]: ... }` field with legacy `anthropicApiKey` / `anthropicBaseUrl` automatically migrated at load time. New helpers `getProviderCredential(config, providerId)` and `buildProviderEnvFlags(providerId, cred)` give code paths a clean way to ask "do I have a credential for X" and "what env vars do I inject when spawning a subprocess for provider X." SessionManager spawn paths are unchanged in this slice — they still read the legacy field; migration to the helper is a follow-up. 14 tests cover migration, kind detection, baseUrl propagation, lookup fallback, and env-flag building for anthropic/openai/google + unknown-provider safe-no-op.

Tier 1.C (Codex intelligence provider) landed: new `CodexCliIntelligenceProvider` sibling of `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider`. Routes evaluate() calls through `codex exec` with tier→model mapping reused from the Codex adapter. Plus a `buildIntelligenceProvider({ framework })` factory that picks the right implementation at startup, and a `frameworkFromEnv()` parser for the new `INSTAR_FRAMEWORK` env var (accepts `claude-code` / `claude` / `codex-cli` / `codex` case-insensitive). Until now `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` was the ONLY implementation, so every reviewer/sentinel/canary ran `claude -p` exclusively — "supports Codex" was a promise we couldn't keep. 10 tests cover framework selection, binary detection fallback, env-var parsing.
