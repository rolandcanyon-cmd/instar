## What Changed

CoherenceReviewer subclasses and CoherenceGate dropped the unused `apiKey` constructor parameter — dead since the Rule 2 path-constraint lockdown removed the direct-Anthropic-API fallback. Reviewer LLM calls already route exclusively through the IntelligenceProvider; the key was being stored but never read.

CoherenceGate now requires an IntelligenceProvider. When none is wired, the response review pipeline is disabled with a warning instead of attempting a raw API fallback.

Internal-only API change: external code that constructs CoherenceGate directly must drop `apiKey` from the options bag and supply `intelligence`.

The anthropic-interactive-pool adapter now accepts an optional `llmFallback` in its config. The empty-prompt canary (Rule 3 detector for the pool's idle signal) had a tested LLM-fallback contract but no application-layer wiring — that's now plumbed end-to-end. Adapter clients can opt in by passing `buildCanaryLlmFallback(intelligence)`; omitting it preserves deterministic-only behavior.

Phase 5c shipped: `CostAwareRoutingPolicy` and `CostStateTracker` in `src/providers/costAwareRouting.ts`. The policy implements the path-constraints "Routing default" (drain SDK credit pot while above the 10% safety margin, switch to subscription floor when at or below). The tracker emits `CostStateSnapshot` objects with a `isMaterialShift` helper Phase 5b consumes to decide when to re-ask the user. Pure additive infrastructure — not yet wired into the runtime; that wiring lands with Phase 5b implementation. 23 unit tests cover every row of the decision matrix and every material-shift category.

Phase 5b.1 shipped: `PreferenceStore` (sqlite-backed cache of framework+model picks keyed by user × task pattern) and `TriggerGate` (pure-function decision logic implementing Phase 5b's three-trigger rule with priority ordering). Both live under `src/providers/uxConfirm/`. The remaining Phase 5b components — TaskClassifier, TelegramConfirmer, OverrideDetector, and the FrameworkModelRouter composition root — land in subsequent slices.

Phase 5b.2 shipped: `TaskClassifier` and `OverrideDetector` — both fast-tier IntelligenceProvider classifiers under `src/providers/uxConfirm/`. The classifier maps a task prompt to a stable kebab-case slug (the cache key for preferences). The detector spots routing overrides in free-text messages ("use Gemini for this one") via LLM, not regex, per the "intelligence over string matching" rule. Both fail-safe on errors — unclassified slug or no-override outcome — so the UX never silently auto-uses a wrong pick. 33 new unit tests pass (13 classifier + 20 detector, including the 8 phrasing variants the spec required).

Phase 5b.3 shipped: `TelegramConfirmer` — the blocking suggest-and-confirm round-trip. Sends the structured prompt via a thin `ConfirmationTransport` interface (testable without real Telegram), blocks on next reply with timeout, parses replies through four deterministic shorthand paths (`ok|c|👍|no|once|/route reset`) before falling through to the LLM-backed `OverrideDetector` for free-text. Returns a discriminated `ConfirmationResult` (`confirmed | overridden | reset | default-no-reply`). 30 new tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage now 86 tests.

Phase 5b.4 shipped: `FrameworkModelRouter` — the composition root that ties every Phase 5b component into the full flow. Returns a structured `RouteResult` with eight distinct `source` values covering every outcome (cached-silent, confirmed, confirmed-one-shot, overridden-this-task, overridden-this-pattern, reset-defaulted, auto-defaulted-no-topic, auto-defaulted-no-reply, auto-defaulted-unclassified). Cache writes are scoped strictly to user-confirmed paths. The `CatalogProvider` interface abstracts over Phase 5a artifacts so the router doesn't read markdown directly. 13 router tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage 99 tests.

Phase 5b.5.a shipped: `StaticCatalogProvider` — hand-curated CatalogProvider implementation. 20 task-pattern defaults derived from the Phase 5a catalogs (code-generation/refactor/debug → Opus 4.7; web-research → Sonnet 4.6; summarize/draft/shell → Haiku 4.5; etc.) plus per-(framework, model) confidence baselines and a `CATALOG_VERSION` string that drives Phase 5b's re-ask trigger. Hand-curated rather than markdown-parsed: deliberate updates when the catalog moves, not silent drift from regex breakage. 16 new tests; cumulative uxConfirm coverage 115 tests.

## Evidence

<!-- REQUIRED if this release claims to fix a bug. -->
<!-- Unit tests passing is NOT evidence. Provide ONE of: -->

<!--       Include log excerpts, observed command output, or behavior -->
<!--       description. Make it specific enough that a future reader can -->
<!--       re-run it and see the same thing. -->
<!--   (b) "Not reproducible in dev — [concrete reason]" if the failure -->
<!--       mode truly can't be exercised locally (race conditions, -->
<!--       event-driven paths requiring external signals, etc). -->
<!--                                                                 -->
