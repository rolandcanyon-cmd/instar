# v1.0.0 — Provider Portability — Running Change Log

This log captures every behavior-affecting change in the provider-portability project as it's made (not retroactively). When v1.0.0 is cut, the released `NEXT.md` is condensed from this.

**Branch:** `spec/provider-portability`
**Status:** in progress (Phase 2 starting 2026-05-14)

---

## Pre-release foundation (no behavior changes yet — spec only)

### 2026-05-14 — Phase 1 foundation complete

- **Functional map produced.** Every file in `src/` (441 files) classified by functional cluster and Claude-coupling level (direct / indirect / none). Roughly 63 files direct, 108 indirect, 270 provider-agnostic. See `specs/provider-portability/00-functional-map.md`.
- **Primitives inventory converged.** Two-pass convergence (Pass 1a expanded inventory from 21 → 33 primitives; Pass 1b verification added 3 + 1 split). Final set: 36 universal primitives across 5 layers. See `specs/provider-portability/01-primitives-inventory.md` and `01b-convergence-report.md`.
- **Codex deep-dive done.** Codex CLI mapped against the 36 primitives; 35 cleanly map, 1 renamed, 5 capability-flagged as asymmetric, 15 new optional primitives surfaced. Final expanded set: 51 primitives. See `specs/provider-portability/02-codex-deep-dive.md`.
- **Interactive-pool feasibility prototype passed.** Shell-script prototype drove a long-lived `claude` REPL through 10 prompts via tmux send-keys + capture-pane; all 10 succeeded; subscription billing confirmed. See `specs/provider-portability/prototype/interactive-pool/findings.md`.

### Decisions locked

- Generic naming throughout. No `claude*` / `anthropic*` in shared interfaces. `claudeSessionId` → `providerSessionId`. `.claude/` → `.agent/<provider>/`. `CLAUDE.md` → `AGENT.md` (alias).
- Two Anthropic adapters in Phase 3: `anthropic-headless-sdk` and `anthropic-interactive-pool`. Routing policy decides.
- Routing default: drain Agent SDK credit first, fall back to interactive pool. (User decision 2026-05-14 — overrode my initial proposal.)
- 51 primitives, 36 universal + 15 optional capability-flagged.
- Canonical Instar event vocabulary at the abstraction boundary; adapters normalize.
- Migration is its own workstream (Phase 7) with local-agent testing before release.

### 2026-05-14 — Phase 2 complete

All TypeScript interfaces and the conformance-test framework for the provider abstraction landed in `src/providers/`. No adapter code yet (that's Phase 3); these are contracts.

- **Foundational types** (4 files): `types.ts` (ProviderId, SessionHandle, ModelTier, UsageReport, ProviderSpecific, CancellationOptions); `capabilities.ts` (CapabilityFlag enum with 36 universal + 18 optional + 5 asymmetric sub-flags); `errors.ts` (ProviderError hierarchy: Auth, Quota, RateLimit, Timeout, Network, Abort, UnsupportedCapability, Unexpected, with type guards); `events.ts` (CanonicalEvent discriminated union — MessageDelta, ToolCall, ToolResult, TurnEnd, SessionLifecycle, SubagentLifecycle, InteractivePrompt, Error, ProviderRaw escape hatch).
- **Transport layer** (6 files): oneShotCompletion, structuredOneShot, agenticSessionHeadless, agenticSessionInteractive, warmSessionInbox (the interactive-pool substrate), agenticSessionRpc.
- **Capability layer** (6 files): toolAccess, toolAllowlist (with MCP identity matching for Codex), fileSystemAccess (read-only / workspace-write / danger-full-access), pathAllowlist (with deny precedence), bashExecution (per-command rules + env policy), webAccess.
- **Observability layer** (9 files): liveOutputStream, conversationLogReader, conversationLogTailer, hookEventReceiver (10+ Claude / 6 Codex hooks with synthesis), subagentLifecycleObserver, sessionId, usageMeterProvider (with `agentSdkCredit` field for Anthropic's $200 pot), processLifecycle, interactivePromptObserver.
- **Control layer** (11 files): inputInjection, hardKill, interrupt, stopGateInterceptor, timeoutBound, idleBound, authCredentialInjection, credentialStorageProvider, contextScopeControl, compactionLifecycle, intelligenceCallQueue.
- **Integration layer** (4 files): providerScaffolder, mcpToolRegistry, sessionResumeIndex, conversationLogProvider.
- **Optional layer** (18 files): threadFork, threadRollback, threadGoalSlot, profileSwitcher, customModelProvider (partial Phase 6 solution via Codex+Ollama), shellEnvironmentPolicy, otelExporter, complianceApi, pluginRegistry, trustedProjectGate (security primitive worth adopting on Claude too), filesystemRpc, processSpawn, capabilityNegotiation, notificationOptOut, codeReviewPreset, csvBatchMode, selfUpdate, requirementsToml.
- **Registry + routing** (2 files): `registry.ts` exposes a singleton `registry` with register / unregister / candidates / resolve / resolvePrimitive; `routing.ts` defines `RoutingPolicy` interface plus three reference policies (FirstAvailable, PreferCapability, Chain). Cost-aware policy is Phase 5.
- **Conformance test framework** (56 files): `runner.ts` (ConformanceContext, ConformanceFactory, contract-assertion stubs); `index.ts` (barrel export of all 54 suites); 54 `runXxxConformance(factory, ctx)` suites — one per primitive — that verify capability flag and method presence. Phase 3+ adapter packages extend these with behavior tests gated by `ctx.realApi`.

**Final total**: 116 TypeScript files in `src/providers/`, all compile cleanly under existing `tsconfig.json` with no errors. 9 commits on `spec/provider-portability` for Phase 2 (steps 1–9). Zero changes to existing source — the entire substrate is additive.

### Phase 2 design notes worth preserving for Phase 3

- The `IntelligenceProvider` interface in `src/core/types.ts` is the in-tree precursor of `OneShotCompletion`. Phase 3a refactor will re-express it through the new substrate (`ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` becomes `anthropic-headless`'s OneShotCompletion implementation).
- `SessionHandle` is opaque to consumers — a branded string at runtime. Each adapter knows how to interpret its own handles; the type system enforces that the same adapter that issued a handle is the one that uses it.
- `WarmSessionInbox` is the substrate for the Phase 3b interactive-pool adapter. The prototype proved the mechanic (tmux send-keys + capture-pane against a long-lived `claude` REPL). The interface accepts an inbox path so callers can use file-system message queues without dictating implementation.
- Asymmetric primitives (`hookEventReceiver`, `usageMeterProvider`, `compactionLifecycle`, `subagentLifecycleObserver`, `interactivePromptObserver`) use sub-capability flags (PublicUsageApi, PreCompactHook, SubagentLifecycleHooks, NativeIdleBound, StructuredApprovalEvents) so routing can prefer authoritative paths when available.
- `customModelProvider` (optional, Codex-native) is the strategic shortcut for Phase 6: routing through Codex with Ollama as the underlying model is faster than building a direct Ollama adapter.
- `trustedProjectGate` (optional, Codex-native) is a security primitive Instar should adopt even on top of Claude — closes the malicious-CLAUDE.md attack surface that Claude lacks native protection for.

### 2026-05-15 — Phase 3a complete

First concrete provider adapter (`anthropic-headless`) landed at `src/providers/adapters/anthropic-headless/`. Implements the Phase 2 substrate by delegating to Anthropic's `claude -p` and existing Instar infrastructure. No changes to existing source — purely additive.

- **Adapter package** (skeleton + 28 primitive implementations + 5 stubs): README, `index.ts` exposing `createAnthropicHeadlessAdapter` factory, `capabilities.ts` declaring the full universal set + Anthropic-favorable asymmetric sub-flags (PublicUsageApi, PreCompactHook, SubagentLifecycleHooks), `config.ts` with env-var defaults, `errors.ts` mapping exec/API errors to canonical hierarchy, `stubs.ts` for primitives without active consumers.
- **Real implementations** for the active-consumer primitives: OneShotCompletion (claude -p with env-scrubbing and OAuth/API-key credential routing), AgenticSessionHeadless (tmux + claude -p with full env injection), HardKill / InputInjection / Interrupt (tmux operations), TimeoutBound / IdleBound (in-memory policy with external watchdog enforcement), AuthCredentialInjection (validate + probe via Messages API), CredentialStorageProvider (file-backed at ~/.instar/anthropic-credentials.json with 0600), ContextScopeControl (--setting-sources mapping), CompactionLifecycle (polls /tmp/claude-session-<id>/compacting marker), StopGateInterceptor (handler registry), SessionId (handle↔Claude-UUID bridge), LiveOutputStream (tmux capture-pane snapshot + tail with ANSI stripping), ProcessLifecycle (tmux list-panes), ConversationLogReader / Tailer (parses ~/.claude/projects/.../jsonl into CanonicalEvents), UsageMeterProvider (Anthropic OAuth /api/oauth/usage), HookEventReceiver (EventEmitter-backed dispatcher; HTTP receiver in monitoring/ feeds via dispatchHookEvent), SubagentLifecycleObserver (filters hook events), SessionResumeIndex (scans ~/.claude/projects), ProviderScaffolder (creates `.agent/anthropic/`), McpToolRegistry (writes `~/.claude.json`), ConversationLogProvider (composes reader+tailer), all 6 CAPABILITY primitives (buildSpec for portable spec construction).
- **Stubs** for primitives without active consumers (throw UnsupportedCapabilityError with clear "not yet implemented" messages): StructuredOneShot, AgenticSessionInteractive, WarmSessionInbox, AgenticSessionRpc, InteractivePromptObserver, IntelligenceCallQueue. The adapter still declares these capabilities so the registry can find it; the throw makes any premature use loud rather than silent.
- **Smoke test** (`_smoketest.ts`, gated by `INSTAR_REAL_API=1`): real `claude -p` invocation through OneShotCompletion returned "4" for "What is 2+2?" in 5 seconds. End-to-end wiring verified against actual Anthropic infrastructure.
- **TypeScript verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit -p .` passes across the entire `src/providers/` tree (Phase 2 substrate + adapter) with zero errors.

### Phase 3a design notes

- The adapter is purely additive in Phase 3a — application code still uses `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` and `SessionManager` directly. The refactor that wires the adapter into the application layer (replacing direct usage with `registry.resolve()`) is queued behind Phase 3b so that the routing policy has both adapters to choose from when it lands.
- SessionHandles issued by the adapter are formatted `anthropic-headless/<tmuxName>`. The `tmuxSessionFromHandle` helper extracts the tmux session name for control operations. Validates the prefix to prevent cross-adapter handle leakage.
- HookEventReceiver in this adapter is the canonical-event end of the path; the HTTP receiver in `src/monitoring/HookEventReceiver.ts` is the wire-protocol end. They wire together via the module-level `dispatchHookEvent` export. The full wiring is a Phase 3 follow-up.
- CredentialStorageProvider defaults to file-backed at `~/.instar/anthropic-credentials.json` (0600 permissions). A Keychain-backed wrapper is deferred — the abstraction supports it via `getBackend`/`setBackend` but only the file backend is wired in Phase 3a.

### 2026-05-15 — Phase 3b complete

Second concrete provider adapter (`anthropic-interactive-pool`) landed at `src/providers/adapters/anthropic-interactive-pool/`. Sister to 3a — same contracts, different transport: instead of one `claude -p` subprocess per call, this adapter maintains a pool of long-lived `claude` REPL sessions in tmux and routes work through them via prompt-injection + idle-marker completion detection. Post-2026-06-15 this is the path that bills against Max subscription rather than the Agent SDK credit pot.

- **Pool internals**: `pool.ts` manages N warm `claude` REPL sessions (default 2, `INSTAR_INTERACTIVE_POOL_SIZE`), allocate / release lifecycle, retire-and-replace, hard-kill-and-replace, observe state. `promptRunner.ts` injects a prompt and detects completion via the idle-marker + output-stability signals validated in the Phase 1 feasibility prototype.
- **Real implementations** for primitives the pool can directly serve: OneShotCompletion (allocate → inject → detect-complete → extract → release), WarmSessionInbox (the primary contract for this adapter — exposes pool sessions to external file-system message-queue callers), HardKill / InputInjection / Interrupt (pool-session control via tmux), LiveOutputStream (tmux capture-pane snapshot + tail), ProcessLifecycle (tmux list-panes for PID/RSS/alive), SessionId (handle ↔ Claude-UUID bridge — distinct from 3a since the UUID comes from REPL startup output rather than `claude -p` exit metadata), TimeoutBound / IdleBound / StopGateInterceptor (in-memory policy), AuthCredentialInjection (env-var routing into pool sessions), ContextScopeControl (--setting-sources flag mapping at session-spawn time), CompactionLifecycle (PreCompact hook with per-pool-session compacting marker).
- **Stubs** for primitives without active 3b consumers (throw UnsupportedCapabilityError): all capability primitives, StructuredOneShot, AgenticSession* (head/interactive/rpc), the asymmetric observability set (ConversationLogReader/Tailer, HookEventReceiver, SubagentLifecycleObserver, UsageMeterProvider, InteractivePromptObserver — those route to 3a today since they share the same underlying ~/.claude/projects log file), CredentialStorageProvider, IntelligenceCallQueue, all four integration primitives. The capability surface still declares them so the registry can find the adapter; the throw makes any premature use loud.
- **Smoke test** (`_smoketest.ts`, gated `INSTAR_REAL_API=1`): real-API run on 2026-05-15 passed — pool size 1 warm in 1019ms, "what is 2+2?" returned "4" in 10.7s through the REPL. Subscription billing path confirmed (no Agent SDK credit drawdown observed).
- **TypeScript verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` passes across the full `src/providers/` tree (Phase 2 substrate + 3a adapter + 3b adapter) with zero errors.

### Phase 3b design notes

- The adapter is purely additive in Phase 3b — application code still uses `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` and `SessionManager` directly. The refactor that wires both 3a and 3b into the application layer lands after 3c, gated on routing-policy implementation.
- SessionHandles issued by the adapter are formatted `anthropic-interactive-pool/<poolSessionId>`. The pool owns the underlying tmux session name; the handle is a stable bridge across pool recycling within a session's lifetime.
- LiveOutputStream reads from `tmux capture-pane` against the pool session's tmux window. The ANSI-strip + output-region extraction matches the 3a path so consumers can switch transparently.
- The asymmetric observability primitives are stubbed (not implemented in 3b) because the underlying source — `~/.claude/projects/<path>/<uuid>.jsonl` — is the same file that 3a's implementations read. A consumer needing those today gets routed to 3a via the registry. If a future pool-only deployment needs them, the 3a implementations should be hoistable with minor refactoring; deferred until that's a real requirement.
- The Phase 1 prototype validated up to ~360-byte responses, single-session pool, no tool use mid-response, no compaction. The Phase 3b smoke covers 1 prompt × 1 session. Pool concurrency, longer responses, tool-call mid-response, and compaction recovery are Phase 3c gates (behavior-parity suite).

---

## What's next

Phase 3c — behavior-parity test suite proving 3a and 3b are functionally equivalent across the shared primitive surface, plus stress tests for pool-only paths (concurrent allocation, retire-and-replace under load, compaction-during-prompt recovery). Once 3c lands, the application-layer refactor begins: replace direct `ClaudeCliIntelligenceProvider` / `SessionManager` usage with `registry.resolve()`, wire the routing policy (drain Agent SDK credit first, fall back to interactive pool below configurable safety margin), and run the migration smoke test on a few local agents before cutting v1.0.0.
