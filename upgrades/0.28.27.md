# Upgrade Guide — vNEXT

<!-- bump: patch -->

## What Changed

- Added POST /jobs/:slug/reset-state endpoint. Clears stale pending state when a job session dies without reporting back, allowing the job to be re-triggered.

## What to Tell Your User

- **Job recovery is now self-service**: "If a job gets stuck in pending state because its session died, you can reset it with a single API call instead of waiting for manual intervention."

## Summary of New Capabilities

| Capability | How to Use |
|-----------|-----------|
| Reset stuck job state | POST /jobs/:slug/reset-state — resets pending to failure so the scheduler can re-trigger |
