## What Changed

Gemini CLI one-shot calls now have a provider-specific capacity policy. When
Gemini reports a 429, `QUOTA_EXHAUSTED`, `resource exhausted`, or a usage/quota
limit, Instar parses any reset window Gemini provides, retries only short
capacity windows once, and otherwise records a local defer window so subsequent
calls fail fast instead of spawning another doomed Gemini process.

Explicit caller-supplied raw Gemini model ids continue to pass through to the
Gemini CLI. Only the automatic `capacityPolicy.fallbackModel` path is
constrained to the known local Gemini model set. When that fallback is valid,
both Gemini execution paths rebuild `gemini -m <model>` on retry from the
policy-selected model, so fallback configuration is not just resolved, it is
actually applied to the next CLI invocation.

## What to Tell Your User

- **Gemini quota handling is calmer:** "When Gemini says its quota is exhausted,
  I now remember the reset window and stop repeatedly poking it. Short capacity
  blips get one bounded retry; longer quota windows are surfaced as a clear
  defer instead of looking like a stalled agent."

## Summary of New Capabilities

| Capability | How to Use |
|-----------|------------|
| Gemini capacity defer window | Automatic for Gemini CLI one-shot calls |
| Short Gemini capacity retry | Automatic, one bounded retry for short windows |
| Known-only Gemini capacity fallback | Automatic; `fallbackModel` swaps only when the fallback is a known Gemini model |
